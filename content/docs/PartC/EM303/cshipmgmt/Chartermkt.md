The international chartering market is a global marketplace where shipowners and charterers negotiate contracts to transport cargo by sea. The five major chartering centers are London, New York, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Singapore.

**London** is the world's largest chartering center, accounting for around 40% of all global chartering activity. It is a leading center for chartering all types of ships, including dry bulk carriers, tankers, container ships, and gas carriers.

**New York** is the second largest chartering center in the world, accounting for around 20% of global chartering activity. It is a major center for chartering tankers and dry bulk carriers, as well as container ships for transatlantic trade.

**Hong Kong** is the third largest chartering center in the world, accounting for around 15% of global chartering activity. It is a major center for chartering all types of ships, but it is particularly strong in the dry bulk and container ship sectors.

**Tokyo** is the fourth largest chartering center in the world, accounting for around 10% of global chartering activity. It is a major center for chartering all types of ships, but it is particularly strong in the tanker sector.

**Singapore** is the fifth largest chartering center in the world, accounting for around 5% of global chartering activity. It is a major center for chartering all types of ships, but it is particularly strong in the container ship sector.

## The international chartering market is a complex and dynamic market, and the relative importance of the five major chartering centers can fluctuate over time. However, all five centers play an important role in the global shipping industry.

Here is a brief overview of the current state of the international chartering market in each of the five major chartering centers:

**London:** The London chartering market is currently experiencing a period of strong demand for all types of ships. This is being driven by a number of factors, including the ongoing economic recovery, the war in Ukraine, and the disruption to global supply chains caused by COVID-19. As a result, freight rates have been rising steadily in recent months.

**New York:** The New York chartering market is also experiencing a period of strong demand, particularly for tankers and dry bulk carriers. This is due to the fact that the United States is a major importer of crude oil and other commodities. As a result, freight rates for tankers and dry bulk carriers have also been rising steadily in recent months.

**Hong Kong:** The Hong Kong chartering market is also experiencing a period of strong demand, particularly for dry bulk carriers and container ships. This is due to the fact that China is a major exporter of goods. As a result, freight rates for dry bulk carriers and container ships have also been rising steadily in recent months.

**Tokyo:** The Tokyo chartering market is experiencing a period of strong demand for tankers, particularly for very large crude carriers (VLCCs) and ultra large crude carriers (ULCCs). This is due to the fact that Japan is a major importer of crude oil. As a result, freight rates for VLCCs and ULCCs have also been rising steadily in recent months.

**Singapore:** The Singapore chartering market is experiencing a period of strong demand for container ships. This is due to the fact that Singapore is a major hub for container shipping. As a result, freight rates for container ships have also been rising steadily in recent months.

Overall, the international chartering market is currently experiencing a period of strong demand for all types of ships. This is being driven by a number of factors, including the ongoing economic recovery, the war in Ukraine, and the disruption to global supply chains caused by COVID-19. As a result, freight rates have been rising steadily in recent months.
