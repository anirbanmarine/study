##  Exceptions to Laytime

In a voyage charterparty agreement, there are certain situations where laytime may be suspended or not counted. These exceptions to laytime are generally outlined in the charterparty terms and conditions. Some common exceptions to laytime include:

1.  **Weather Conditions:** Laytime may be suspended or not counted during periods of bad weather, such as heavy rain, storms, or fog, which can disrupt or delay loading and discharging operations. This type of exception is often referred to as Weather Working Days (WWD).
2.  **Weekends and Holidays:** Laytime may be excluded on weekends, public holidays, or any other non-working days agreed upon in the charterparty. This exception is typically referred to as “Saturdays, Sundays, and Holidays Excepted” (SSHE) or “Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays Included” (SSHI), depending on whether laytime is counted or not during those days.
3.  **Force Majeure Events:** Laytime may be suspended during unforeseeable events or circumstances beyond the control of the parties involved, such as natural disasters, strikes, war, or other similar events. Force majeure clauses in the charterparty protect both parties from being held responsible for delays or failures in performance due to such events.
4.  **Breakdowns or Accidents:** Laytime may be suspended if the ship experiences a breakdown, accident, or any other operational issue that prevents the loading or discharging of cargo.
5.  **Customs or Regulatory Delays:** Laytime may be suspended or not counted during delays caused by customs inspections, port authority regulations, or other bureaucratic procedures.
6.  **Waiting for Berth:** Laytime may be suspended while the ship is waiting for a berth to become available at the port. This exception is typically referred to as “Waiting for Berth” or “Berth or No Berth” clauses.
7.  **Shifting Between Berths:** Laytime may be suspended during the time spent by the ship shifting between berths, as long as the shifting is not due to the ship’s fault or inefficiency.
8.  **Specific Charterparty Clauses:** The charterparty agreement may include additional exceptions or suspensions to laytime based on the specific circumstances or requirements of the parties involved.

It is essential for both the shipowner and the charterer to be aware of these exceptions to laytime, as they can significantly impact the calculation of **Demurrage or Despatch payments in a voyage charterparty agreement**.
