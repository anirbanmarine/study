Demersal and pelagic fishing are two different types of fishing that target different types of fish in different habitats.

## Demersal fishing 

is the fishing of fish that live on or near the bottom of the ocean. These fish are also known as groundfish. Demersal fish are typically caught using bottom trawls, gillnets, and longlines.Some examples of demersal fish include cod, haddock, flounder, sole, and shrimp.

## Pelagic fishing 

is the fishing of fish that live in the open ocean, away from the bottom. These fish are also known as midwater fish. Pelagic fish are typically caught using purse seines, pelagic trawls, and troll lines.Some examples of pelagic fish include tuna, mackerel, herring, and sardines.



 
Both demersal and pelagic fishing can have a significant impact on marine ecosystems. Overfishing is a major threat to both types of fish populations. Demersal fishing can also damage the seabed, which can impact other marine organisms. Pelagic fishing can lead to bycatch, which is the accidental capture of non-target species, such as seabirds and dolphins.

It is important to manage demersal and pelagic fisheries sustainably to ensure that these resources remain available for future generations. Some sustainable fishing practices include:

1. Using selective fishing gear to avoid bycatch.
2. Setting catch limits to prevent overfishing.
3. Protecting spawning grounds and other important fish habitats.
4. Monitoring fish populations to ensure that they are healthy and sustainable.

Individuals can also play a role in supporting sustainable demersal and pelagic fisheries by choosing seafood that has been caught or farmed sustainably.
