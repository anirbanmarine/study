## Fish Types

Types of fish marine resources can be classified according to their body type, habitat, or commercial value.

### According to body type:

#### Bony fish: 

This is the largest group of fish, accounting for over 95% of all fish species. They have a skeleton made of bone and a swim bladder that helps them control their buoyancy. Examples of bony fish include tuna, cod, salmon, and herring.

#### Cartilaginous fish: 

This group includes sharks, rays, and skates. They have a skeleton made of cartilage, which is lighter and more flexible than bone. Cartilaginous fish also do not have a swim bladder.

#### Jawless fish: 

This is the most primitive group of fish, and includes lampreys and hagfishes. They do not have jaws or paired fins.

### According to habitat:

#### Pelagic fish: 

These fish live in the open ocean, away from the coast. Examples of pelagic fish include tuna, mackerel, and swordfish.

#### Demersal fish: 

These fish live on or near the bottom of the ocean. Examples of demersal fish include cod, haddock, and flounder.

#### Reef fish: 

These fish live in coral reefs and other rocky structures. Examples of reef fish include clownfish, parrotfish, and angelfish.

### According to commercial value:

#### Food fish: 

These fish are caught and sold for human consumption. Examples of food fish include tuna, salmon, cod, and shrimp.

#### Industrial fish: 

These fish are caught and processed for non-food products, such as fishmeal and fish oil. Examples of industrial fish include anchovies and menhaden.

#### Ornamental fish: 

These fish are caught and sold for use in aquariums. Examples of ornamental fish include clownfish, angelfish, and goldfish.

### Some of the most important marine fish resources in the world include:

Tuna
Salmon
Cod
Herring
Mackerel
Shrimp
Anchovies
Menhaden
Sardines
Pollock
Hake
Flatfish

These fish are important sources of food, protein, and other nutrients for people around the world. They are also important for the marine ecosystem, playing a role in the food chain and helping to maintain balance in the ocean.

However, many marine fish populations are threatened by overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. It is important to manage these resources sustainably to ensure that they remain available for future generations.
