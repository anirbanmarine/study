## What are fishing grounds?

Fishing grounds are areas of the ocean where fish are abundant and can be caught commercially. They are typically located in areas where there is a lot of food for fish, such as near continental shelves, upwelling areas, and around coral reefs.

The geographical location of fishing grounds varies depending on the type of fish being targeted. For example, tuna fishing grounds are typically located in tropical and subtropical waters, while cod fishing grounds are typically located in colder waters.

## Some of the most important fishing grounds in the world include:

1. The North Atlantic, including the Gulf of Maine, the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, and the Norwegian Sea.
2. The Northeast Pacific, including the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska.
3. The Northwest Pacific, including the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea.
4. The Southeast Pacific, including the Humboldt Current and the Patagonian Shelf.
5. The Southwest Atlantic, including the Falkland Islands and the Gulf of Guinea.
6. The Indian Ocean, including the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.

These fishing grounds support a wide range of commercial fisheries, which provide food and jobs for millions of people around the world.

However, it is important to note that many fishing grounds are under pressure from overfishing and other threats. It is important to manage these resources sustainably to ensure that they remain productive for future generations.
