There are three main types of sea terminals:

## General cargo terminals: 

These terminals handle a variety of types of cargo, including break-bulk cargo (such as machinery and vehicles), neo-bulk cargo (such as grain and forest products), and containerized cargo.


## Bulk cargo terminals: 

These terminals handle bulk cargo, such as coal, grain, iron ore, and oil. Bulk cargo terminals are typically specialized to handle a specific type of cargo.

## Passenger terminals: 

These terminals handle passenger traffic, such as ferries and cruise ships. Passenger terminals typically have facilities for processing passengers, such as customs and immigration checkpoints, as well as amenities for passengers, such as restaurants and shops.

General cargo terminals are the most common type of sea terminal. They are typically located in major ports and handle a wide variety of cargo. Bulk cargo terminals are typically located in ports that are close to the sources of the bulk cargo that they handle. Passenger terminals are typically located in ports that are popular tourist destinations.

In addition to these three main types of sea terminals, there are also a number of specialized sea terminals, such as:

## Container terminals: 

These terminals are designed specifically to handle containerized cargo. Container terminals are typically equipped with large cranes and other specialized equipment for loading and unloading containers.

## RoRo terminals: 

These terminals are designed specifically to handle roll-on/roll-off cargo, such as cars and trucks. RoRo terminals typically have ramps and other specialized equipment for loading and unloading RoRo cargo.

## LNG terminals: 

These terminals are designed to handle liquefied natural gas (LNG). LNG terminals are typically equipped with specialized equipment for storing and regasifying LNG.

The type of sea terminal that is used depends on the type of cargo that is being handled. For example, if a containerized cargo is being handled, a container terminal will be used. If a bulk cargo is being handled, a bulk cargo terminal will be used. If a passenger ship is being handled, a passenger terminal will be used.

Sea terminals play an important role in the global economy. They allow goods to be transported efficiently between different parts of the world. Sea terminals are also a major source of jobs in many port cities.
