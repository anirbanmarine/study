There are a variety of storage facilities used for oil and gas, depending on the type of product being stored and the location. Some of the most common types of storage facilities include:

## Above-ground tanks: 

Above-ground tanks are the most common type of storage tank for oil and gas. They can be made of steel, concrete, or fiberglass, and come in a variety of sizes and shapes. Above-ground tanks are typically used for storing crude oil, refined petroleum products, and natural gas liquids. 



## Underground storage tanks: 

Underground storage tanks (USTs) are used to store oil and gas products underground. They are typically made of steel or fiberglass, and are lined with a protective coating to prevent leaks. USTs are typically used to store gasoline, diesel fuel, and heating oil. 


## Caverns: 

Caverns are natural or man-made underground chambers that can be used to store oil and gas. Caverns are typically used to store large volumes of crude oil and natural gas. The United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), the world's largest supply of emergency crude oil, is stored in underground salt caverns along the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico. 

## LNG tanks: 

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanks are used to store LNG, which is natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state. LNG tanks are typically made of steel or concrete, and are insulated to keep the LNG cold. LNG tanks are typically used at LNG terminals and LNG regasification plants. 

In addition to these types of storage facilities, oil and gas can also be stored in tankers and pipelines. Tankers are used to transport oil and gas long distances, and can also be used to store them temporarily. Pipelines are used to transport oil and gas over land, and can also be used to store them temporarily.

The type of storage facility used for oil and gas will depend on the specific needs of the project. For example, if a large volume of crude oil needs to be stored for a long period of time, a cavern may be the best option. If LNG needs to be stored, an LNG tank may be the best option.
