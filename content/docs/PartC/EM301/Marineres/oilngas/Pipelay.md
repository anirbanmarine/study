## Definition:

Pipe laying is the process of installing pipelines on the seabed or underground. Submersibles are vehicles that can operate underwater. They are used in a variety of tasks, including pipe laying.

## Types of submersibles used in pipe laying

There are two main types of submersibles used in pipe laying:

### Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs): 

ROVs are unmanned submersibles that are controlled from a surface vessel. They are typically used for tasks such as inspection, maintenance, and repair.


### Manned submersibles: 

Manned submersibles have a crew that operates the vehicle from inside. They are typically used for tasks that require human intervention, such as pipe laying and welding.

## How submersibles are used in pipe laying?

Submersibles are used in a variety of ways in pipe laying operations. Some of the most common tasks include:

* Inspection: 
Submersibles can be used to inspect the seabed before pipe laying begins to identify any potential hazards.

* Preparation: Submersibles can be used to prepare the seabed for pipe laying by clearing away obstacles and leveling the surface.

* Pipe laying: Submersibles can be used to lay pipe on the seabed. This is typically done by using a manipulator arm to attach the pipe to the seabed and then moving the submersible forward.

* Welding: Submersibles can be used to weld the joints between pipe sections.

* Inspection and repair: Submersibles can be used to inspect and repair pipelines after they have been laid.

## Advantages of using submersibles in pipe laying

There are a number of advantages to using submersibles in pipe laying operations, including:

* Accuracy: Submersibles can be used to lay pipe very accurately, even in deep water and challenging conditions.
* Flexibility: Submersibles can be used to lay pipe in a variety of environments, including on the seabed, in rivers and lakes, and in underground tunnels.
* Safety: Submersibles can provide a safe way to lay pipe in dangerous environments, such as in areas with strong currents or underwater hazards.

Conclusion

Submersibles are a valuable tool for pipe laying operations. They can be used to perform a variety of tasks, including inspection, preparation, pipe laying, welding, and inspection and repair. Submersibles offer a number of advantages over other pipe laying methods, including accuracy, flexibility, and safety.
