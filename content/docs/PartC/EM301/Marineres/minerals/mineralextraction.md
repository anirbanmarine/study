## Definition

The extraction of minerals from the seabed is a relatively new and developing industry. It involves the retrieval of mineral deposits from the ocean floor at depths of 200 metres /660 feet or more.

There are three main types of mineral deposits that are of interest for seabed mining: polymetallic nodules, seafloor massive sulfides (SMS), and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts.

### Polymetallic nodules 

are potato-sized rocks that are found on the deep ocean floor. They contain a variety of metals, including nickel, copper, manganese, and cobalt.

### Seafloor massive 

sulfides are formed by hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. They contain a variety of metals, including copper, zinc, lead, gold, and silver.

### Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts 

are thin layers of metal-rich material that coat rocks on the ocean floor. They contain a variety of metals, including cobalt, nickel, and manganese.

## Extraction Process

The extraction of minerals from the seabed is a complex and challenging process. The ocean floor is a hostile environment, and the mineral deposits are often located in deep water. This makes it difficult and expensive to mine the minerals.

There are a number of different methods that are being developed for extracting minerals from the seabed. 

1. One common method is to use a collector vehicle to collect the minerals from the ocean floor. The collector vehicle is then attached to a riser system that transports the minerals to a surface vessel.

2. Another method of extracting minerals from the seabed is to use a seafloor mining system. Seafloor mining systems are large machines that can be used to mine a variety of mineral deposits.

The extraction of minerals from the seabed is a controversial topic. Some people argue that seabed mining is necessary to meet the growing demand for metals. Others argue that seabed mining is too risky and that it could damage the marine environment.

There are a number of environmental concerns associated with seabed mining. 

* One concern is that seabed mining could damage sensitive marine habitats. 

* Another concern is that seabed mining could release harmful chemicals and sediments into the water.

* Noise pollution : Mining operations could produce a lot of noise which could disturb marine animals and disrupt heir communication.

* Biodiversity loss of deep-sea species which are not well-studied and understood.


It is important to weigh the environmental risks and benefits of seabed mining before making a decision about whether or not to allow seabed mining to proceed.
