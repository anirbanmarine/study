## Definition

Seabed sampling is the process of collecting sediment and rock samples from the ocean floor. 

## Seabed samples are collected for a variety of purposes, including:

### To study the composition and distribution of seabed sediments: 

This information can be used to understand the geological history of an area, as well as to identify potential resources, such as minerals and oil and gas.

### To monitor the environmental health of the ocean:

 Seabed samples can be analyzed for contaminants, such as heavy metals and pesticides. This information can be used to identify and track pollution sources, as well as to assess the impact of human activities on the marine environment.
### To support engineering projects: 

Seabed samples can be analyzed to determine the suitability of the seabed for construction projects, such as bridges and pipelines.

## Seabed Sampling Methods

There are a variety of different seabed sampling methods, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common seabed sampling methods include:

1. Grab samplers: Grab samplers are used to collect samples of the surface sediment layer. They typically consist of a metal bucket that is attached to a wire rope and lowered to the seabed. When the bucket reaches the seabed, it is closed and then retrieved to the surface.

2. Corers: Corers are used to collect samples of the sediment column. They typically consist of a long metal tube that is attached to a wire rope and lowered to the seabed. When the corer reaches the seabed, it is pushed into the sediment. The corer is then retrieved to the surface, and the sediment sample is removed from the tube.

3. Dredges: Dredges are used to collect large samples of sediment and rock from the seabed. They typically consist of a bucket or scoop that is attached to a wire rope and lowered to the seabed. The dredge is then dragged across the seabed to collect the sample.


The best seabed sampling method for a particular application depends on the type of sample required, the depth of the water, and the seabed conditions.

Seabed sampling is an important tool for studying the ocean and its resources. By collecting and analyzing seabed samples, we can learn more about the geological history of the ocean, identify potential resources, monitor environmental health, and support engineering projects.
