## What is a Submarine Atlas?

A submarine atlas is a collection of maps and charts that show the features of the ocean floor. Submarine atlases are used for a variety of purposes, including navigation, scientific research, and resource management.

The following are some of the steps involved in preparing a submarine atlas:

1. Collect data: The first step is to collect data about the ocean floor. This data can be collected using a variety of methods, including bathymetric surveys, acoustic imaging, and satellite remote sensing.

2. Process data: Once the data has been collected, it needs to be processed to create maps and charts of the ocean floor. This processing typically involves using computer software to create a digital model of the ocean floor.

3. Produce maps and charts: The next step is to produce maps and charts of the ocean floor. These maps and charts can be used for a variety of purposes, including navigation, scientific research, and resource management.

4. Publish the atlas: The final step is to publish the atlas. This can be done in a variety of formats, including print, digital, or online.

###Conclusion

Submarine atlases are important tools for understanding and managing the ocean floor

## Definitions of Various Oceanic Features:

### Shelf

The continental shelf is the submerged extension of a continent's continental margin. It is typically a gently sloping plain that extends from the shoreline to the edge of the continental slope. The continental shelf is typically less than 650 feet (200 meters) deep and is covered in a variety of sediments, including sand, mud, and gravel.

### Floor

The ocean floor is the deepest part of the ocean and is located beneath the continental shelf and slope. The ocean floor is divided into three main regions: the abyssal plain, the mid-ocean ridges, and the deep-sea trenches.

The abyssal plain is the largest region of the ocean floor and is covered in a thick layer of sediment. The mid-ocean ridges are a series of mountain ranges that run through the center of the ocean basins. The deep-sea trenches are the deepest parts of the ocean and are located at the subduction zones where oceanic crust sinks beneath continental crust.

### Slope

The continental slope is the steep slope that descends from the continental shelf to the ocean floor. The continental slope is typically less than 12 miles (20 kilometers) wide and has a slope of 4-7 degrees. The continental slope is covered in a variety of sediments, including sand, mud, gravel, and rocks.

### Ridges

Mid-ocean ridges are a series of mountain ranges that run through the center of the ocean basins. Mid-ocean ridges are formed by seafloor spreading, which is the process by which new oceanic crust is created at the divergent boundaries of tectonic plates.

### Oceanic Sedimentation

Oceanic sedimentation is the process by which sediment is deposited on the ocean floor. Sediment can come from a variety of sources, including rivers, glaciers, and volcanic eruptions. The type and thickness of sediment on the ocean floor can vary depending on the source of the sediment and the depth of the ocean.

## Modern Terminology

The following is a list of modern terminology related to oceanic features:

### Abyssal plain: The largest region of the ocean floor, covered in a thick layer of sediment.

### Active margin: A continental margin where oceanic crust is subducting beneath continental crust.

### Bathymetry: The study of the depth and shape of the ocean floor.

### Continental margin: The transition zone between the continent and the ocean.

### Continental shelf: The submerged extension of a continent's continental margin.

### Continental slope: The steep slope that descends from the continental shelf to the ocean floor.

### Deep-sea trench: The deepest part of the ocean, located at the subduction zones where oceanic crust sinks beneath continental crust.
### Divergent boundary: A boundary between two tectonic plates that are moving away from each other.

### Mid-ocean ridge: A series of mountain ranges that run through the center of the ocean basins.

### Oceanic crust: The thin layer of crust that covers the ocean floor.

### Passive margin: A continental margin where there is no active subduction of oceanic crust.

### Seafloor spreading: The process by which new oceanic crust is created at the divergent boundaries of tectonic plates.

### Subduction zone: A region where oceanic crust sinks beneath continental crust.

### Tectonic plate: A large, rigid slab of rock that makes up the Earth's lithosphere.
