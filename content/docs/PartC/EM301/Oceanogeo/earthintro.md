## The Earth
Earth is a terrestrial planet in the Solar System, the third planet from the Sun. It is the only astronomical object known to support life. Earth is a sphere with a slightly flattened diameter of about 12,742 kilometers (7,918 mi). Its mass is about 5.972 × 10^24 kilograms (1.317 × 10^25 lb). Earth's atmosphere is composed of 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. Earth's hydrosphere covers about 71% of its surface and is essential for life.

## Earth's interior is divided into three main layers:

1. The crust is the outermost layer and is made up of solid rock. It is about 5 to 70 kilometers (3 to 43 mi) thick.

2. The mantle is the middle layer and is made up of molten rock. It is about 2,900 kilometers (1,800 mi) thick.

3. The core is the innermost layer and is made up of solid iron and nickel. It is about 7,000 kilometers (4,300 mi) thick.

## Earth's interior age

The age of Earth's interior is estimated to be about 4.54 billion years old. This is based on the age of meteorites, which are thought to have formed from the same material as the early Earth.

## Scientists have used a variety of methods to estimate the age of Earth's interior, including:

1. Radiometric dating: This method uses the decay of radioactive isotopes to determine the age of rocks and minerals.

2. Paleomagnetism: This method studies the magnetic field of the Earth as it has changed over time.

3. Geochronology: This method studies the layering of rocks to determine their relative ages.
These methods have all given similar ages for Earth's interior, suggesting that it formed about 4.54 billion years ago.

Conclusion:

Earth is a dynamic planet with a complex interior. Scientists are still learning about the age and composition of Earth's interior, but they have made significant progress in recent years.
