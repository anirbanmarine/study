## General characteristics of the seas

Seas are smaller bodies of water than oceans and are usually partially enclosed by land.
Seas are typically shallower than oceans, with an average depth of about 650 feet (200 meters).
The salinity of seas can vary depending on the location, but it is generally lower than the salinity of oceans.
Seas are home to a variety of marine life, including fish, shellfish, and seabirds.
Bottom topography of the seas

## The bottom topography of the seas can vary depending on the location. However, there are some general trends:


1. The continental shelf is the submerged extension of a continent's continental margin. It is typically a gently sloping plain that extends from the shoreline to the edge of the continental slope.

2. The continental slope is the steep slope that descends from the continental shelf to the ocean floor.

3. The ocean floor is the deepest part of the ocean and is located beneath the continental shelf and slope. The ocean floor is divided into three main regions: the abyssal plain, the mid-ocean ridges, and the deep-sea trenches.
Coastline and beaches

### The coastline 

is the boundary between the land and the sea. Coastlines can be classified into two main types: erosional and depositional.

### Erosional coastlines 

are characterized by cliffs, rocky shores, and other features that have been created by the erosion of the land by the sea. Depositional coastlines are characterized by beaches, sand dunes, and other features that have been created by the deposition of sediment by the sea.

### Beaches 

are narrow strips of sand or gravel that are located along the coastline. Beaches are formed by the deposition of sediment by the waves and currents. Beaches can vary in size and shape depending on the location and the type of sediment that is available.

### Conclusion

The seas are important ecosystems that provide a variety of benefits to humans, including food, recreation, and transportation. The bottom topography of the seas, the coastline, and the beaches are all important factors that influence the distribution of marine life and the availability of resources for humans.
