Control in hydrographic surveying is the process of establishing a network of known horizontal and vertical positions that is used to reference all other survey measurements. Control is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of hydrographic surveys.

There are two main types of control in hydrographic surveying: horizontal control and vertical control.

## Horizontal control 

establishes the horizontal position of survey points. It is typically established using a network of geodetic survey markers, such as triangulation stations and GPS reference points. Horizontal control can also be established using photogrammetric methods, such as aerial photography and satellite imagery.

## Vertical control 

establishes the vertical position of survey points. It is typically established using a network of bench marks, which are fixed points with known elevations. Vertical control can also be established using tidal gauges and GPS measurements.

Once the horizontal and vertical control networks have been established, survey points can be referenced to the control network using a variety of positioning technologies, such as GPS, DGPS, and GNSS.

** Control** is essential for hydrographic surveying because it ensures that all survey measurements are referenced to a common coordinate system. This is important for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the survey results.

In addition to ensuring accuracy, control also provides a number of other benefits for hydrographic surveys. For example, control can be used to:

* **Reduce the amount of time and resources required to complete a survey.** By using control, hydrographic surveyors can avoid having to resurvey areas that have already been surveyed.
* **Improve the quality of survey data.** Control can help to identify and correct errors in survey data.
* **Integrate data from different sources.** Control can be used to integrate data from different hydrographic surveys, as well as data from other sources, such as aerial photography and satellite imagery.

Control networks for hydrographic surveys are typically designed and established by geodetic surveyors. However, hydrographic surveyors are responsible for ensuring that the control network is adequate for the specific needs of their survey.

## Here are some of the factors that hydrographic surveyors need to consider when planning and executing a survey:

* The size and complexity of the survey area.
* The required accuracy of the survey results.
* The availability of existing control points.
* The budget and time constraints of the survey.
* The specific hydrographic survey methods that will be used.

Once the hydrographic surveyor has considered all of these factors, they can develop a plan for establishing a control network. The specific control techniques that are used will vary depending on the factors listed above.

For example, a hydrographic survey of a small harbor might use a simple control network of existing triangulation stations. A hydrographic survey of a large offshore area might require a more complex control network, including new GPS reference points, tide gauges, and photogrammetric methods.

Control is an essential element of hydrographic surveying. It ensures that all survey measurements are referenced to a common coordinate system and that the survey results are accurate and reliable. Hydrographic surveyors carefully plan and execute their surveys to ensure that the control network is adequate for the specific needs of their project.

## Case study: Hydrographic survey of a new port**

A new port is being built on a previously uncharted stretch of coastline. The hydrographic survey team is responsible for creating a detailed map of the seabed in the port area. The survey team will use this map to design the port and to ensure that it is safe for ships to enter and leave.

The survey team begins by establishing a control network. They use GPS to survey a number of points on the coastline. These points will be used as references for all other survey measurements.

Once the control network is in place, the survey team begins to collect data on the seabed. They use a variety of hydrographic survey methods, including multibeam sonar and side scan sonar. These methods allow the survey team to create a detailed three-dimensional image of the seabed.

The survey team collects data on the depth of the water, the position of underwater features, and the composition of the seabed. This data is then processed using specialized software to create a nautical chart of the port area.

The nautical chart shows the depth of water, the position of underwater features, and other important information for navigation. The port authorities will use this chart to design the port and to ensure that it is safe for ships to enter and leave.

This case study demonstrates the importance of control in hydrographic surveying. Control is essential for ensuring that all survey measurements are accurate and reliable. This is especially important for high-stakes projects, such as the construction of a new port.
