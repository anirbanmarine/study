Tides can be classified in a number of ways, including by frequency, range, and type.

## Frequency

Tides can be classified by frequency based on the number of high and low tides that occur each day. The three main types of tidal frequencies are:

1. **Diurnal tides:** One high tide and one low tide per day.
2. **Semi-diurnal tides:** Two high tides and two low tides per day.
3. **Mixed tides:** A combination of diurnal and semi-diurnal tides, with the number of high and low tides varying per day.

## Range

Tides can also be classified by range, which is the difference in height between the high and low tides. The three main types of tidal ranges are:

1. **Microtidal tides:** A range of less than 2 meters.
2. **Mesotidal tides:** A range of 2 to 4 meters.
3. **Macrotidal tides:** A range of more than 4 meters.

## Type

Tides can also be classified by type, based on the forces that cause them. The three main types of tides are:

1. **Astronomical tides:** Caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun.
2. **Meteorological tides:** Caused by atmospheric pressure changes and winds.
3. **Seiches:** Caused by the resonant oscillation of water in enclosed or semi-enclosed bodies of water, such as lakes and bays.

## Examples

Here are some examples of different types of tides:

1. **Diurnal tides:** Diurnal tides are common in the tropics, where the moon passes overhead twice a day.
2. **Semi-diurnal tides:** Semi-diurnal tides are common in temperate and polar regions, where the moon passes overhead once a day.
3. **Mixed tides:** Mixed tides are found in many coastal areas, where the shape of the coastline and the ocean basin can affect the frequency of the tides.
4. **Microtidal tides:** Microtidal tides are found along most of the coast of California.
5. **Mesotidal tides:** Mesotidal tides are found along most of the coast of the United States, as well as along the coasts of Europe and Asia.
6. **Macrotidal tides:** Macrotidal tides are found along the coast of Canada, the Bay of Fundy, and the coast of Patagonia.
7. **Astronomical tides:** Astronomical tides are the most common type of tide. They are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun.
8. **Meteorological tides:** Meteorological tides are less common than astronomical tides. They are caused by atmospheric pressure changes and winds.
8. **Seiches:** Seiches are rare, but they can occur in enclosed or semi-enclosed bodies of water, such as lakes and bays.

Tides are a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors. However, the classification of tides by frequency, range, and type can help us to better understand and predict the tides.
