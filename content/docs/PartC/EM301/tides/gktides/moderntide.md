* Modern tidal theory is based on the dynamic theory of tides, which was developed in the 18th and 19th centuries. The dynamic theory of tides takes into account the effects of the Earth's rotation, the shape of the ocean basins, and the friction between the water and the seabed.

* Modern tidal theory is used to predict the tides at any location on Earth. To do this, scientists use complex computer models that take into account all of the factors that influence the tides. These models are used to create tide tables, which show the predicted times and heights of the tides for each day of the year.

* Modern tidal theory is also used to study the long-term effects of climate change on the tides. For example, scientists are using tidal models to predict how the tides will change as sea levels rise.

Here are some of the key features of modern tidal theory:

* **It takes into account the effects of the Earth's rotation.** The Earth's rotation causes the tides to lag behind the moon and the sun. This lag is responsible for the semi-diurnal tides, which are the two high tides and two low tides per day.
* **It takes into account the shape of the ocean basins.** The shape of the ocean basins can affect the tides in a number of ways. For example, the tides in a funnel-shaped basin will be higher than the tides in a rectangular basin.
* **It takes into account the friction between the water and the seabed.** Friction between the water and the seabed slows down the tides and makes them less predictable.

Modern tidal theory is a complex and sophisticated theory that is used to predict the tides and to study the long-term effects of climate change on the tides.

## Here are some examples of how modern tidal theory is used:

* **Tide prediction:** Modern tidal theory is used to predict the tides at any location on Earth. This information is used by mariners, fishermen, and other people who need to know when the tides will be high and low.
* **Coastal engineering:** Modern tidal theory is used by coastal engineers to design structures that can withstand the tides. For example, tidal models are used to design seawalls and breakwaters.
* **Climate change research:** Modern tidal theory is used by climate scientists to study the long-term effects of climate change on the tides. For example, tidal models are used to predict how the tides will change as sea levels rise.

Modern tidal theory is an essential tool for understanding and predicting the tides. It is used by a variety of people and organizations for a variety of purposes.
