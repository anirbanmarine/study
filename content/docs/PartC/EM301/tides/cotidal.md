## **Co-tidal charts** 

Co- Tidal Charts are a valuable tool for mariners, fishermen, coastal engineers, and climate scientists. They provide information about the tidal wave propagation, which is the movement of the tides through the oceans. This information can be used to predict the times and heights of the high and low tides, as well as the direction of the tidal currents.

Co-tidal charts are created using a variety of data, including tide gauge data, satellite data, and computer models. The data is used to calculate the tidal wave propagation, which is then used to create the co-tidal charts. Co-tidal charts are typically divided into two types: co-phase charts and co-range charts. Co-phase charts show the time of the high and low tides, while co-range charts show the height of the high and low tides. Co-tidal charts can also be used to predict the direction of the tidal currents.

## Co-tidal charts are used in a variety of ways, including:

* **Navigation:** Mariners use co-tidal charts to plan their voyages and to avoid hazards, such as shallow water and strong currents.
* **Fishing:** Fishermen use co-tidal charts to find the best places to fish and to predict the movement of fish.
* **Coastal engineering:** Coastal engineers use co-tidal charts to design coastal structures, such as seawalls and breakwaters.
* **Climate change research:** Scientists use co-tidal charts to study the effects of climate change on the tides.

## Here are some specific examples of how co-tidal charts are used:

* A mariner uses a co-tidal chart to plan a voyage through a narrow channel. The chart shows the mariner when the high and low tides will occur, as well as the direction of the tidal currents. This information allows the mariner to safely navigate the channel.
* A fisherman uses a co-tidal chart to find the best place to fish for salmon. The chart shows the fisherman when the tides will be high and low, as well as the direction of the tidal currents. This information allows the fisherman to find the best places to fish and to predict the movement of salmon.
* A coastal engineer uses a co-tidal chart to design a seawall. The chart shows the engineer the height of the high and low tides, as well as the direction of the tidal currents. This information allows the engineer to design a seawall that can withstand the forces of the tides and waves.
* A scientist uses a co-tidal chart to study the effects of climate change on the tides. The chart shows the scientist how the tides have changed over time. This information allows the scientist to study the effects of climate change on the tides and to predict how the tides will change in the future.

Co-tidal charts are an essential tool for a variety of people and organizations. They provide valuable information about the tidal wave propagation, which can be used to predict the tides, plan voyages, find the best places to fish, design coastal structures, and study the effects of climate change on the tides.
