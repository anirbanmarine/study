## Quantitative estimation of sea surface temperature (SST) can be done using a variety of methods, including:

1. **Satellite remote sensing:** Satellites equipped with infrared and microwave sensors can be used to measure SST from space. These sensors measure the amount of infrared and microwave radiation emitted by the sea surface, which is related to its temperature.

2. **In situ measurements:** In situ measurements of SST can be made using a variety of sensors, such as buoys, ships, and aircraft. These sensors measure the temperature of the water directly.In situ measurements of SST are more accurate than satellite measurements, but they are limited in spatial and temporal coverage. In situ measurements are also more expensive to collect.


3. **Data assimilation:** Data assimilation techniques can be used to combine satellite and in situ measurements to produce a more accurate estimate of SST.Data assimilation techniques take into account the uncertainties in the satellite and in situ measurements to produce the best possible estimate of SST.

Satellite remote sensing is the most widely used method for quantitative estimation of SST. It provides global coverage with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, satellite SST measurements can be affected by factors such as clouds and aerosols.


## What are the uses of SST

Once SST has been estimated, it can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

1. **Monitoring climate change:** SST is an important indicator of climate change. By monitoring SST over time, scientists can track how the Earth's climate is changing.

2. **Forecasting weather:** SST is used in weather forecasting models to predict the formation and movement of weather systems, such as hurricanes and typhoons.

3. **Monitoring marine ecosystems:** SST is an important factor in the distribution and abundance of marine life. By monitoring SST, scientists can track changes in marine ecosystems and identify potential threats.

Quantitative estimation of SST is an important tool for scientists and policymakers. It provides valuable information about the Earth's climate and marine ecosystems.
