## What is ISMP?

The Indian Satellite Meteorology Programme (ISMP) is a joint initiative of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The ISMP was established in the early 1970s, and it has played a vital role in the development of India's meteorological capabilities.

## What are the key objectives of ISMP? 

The ISMP's primary objective is to provide IMD with the satellite data needed to improve weather forecasting and to monitor climate change. The ISMP operates a fleet of geostationary and polar-orbiting weather satellites, which provide IMD with a wide range of data about the Earth's atmosphere, including cloud cover, temperature, moisture, and wind speed.

The ISMP has made significant contributions to the improvement of weather forecasting in India. For example, IMD is now able to provide more accurate and timely warnings of severe weather events, such as cyclones, floods, and droughts. The ISMP has also played a vital role in the development of India's climate change monitoring and research capabilities.

## The following are some of the key milestones in the development of the ISMP:

1975: Launch of Aryabhata, India's first satellite.
1979: Launch of Bhaskara-1, India's first satellite dedicated to earth observation.
1982: Launch of INSAT-1A, India's first geostationary satellite.
1997: Launch of Kalpana-1 (formerly METSAT), India's first satellite dedicated to meteorological observations.
2013: Launch of INSAT-3D, India's first geostationary satellite to carry a sounder.
2016: Launch of INSAT-3DR, India's second geostationary satellite to carry a sounder.
The ISMP is a major success story, and it has played a vital role in the development of India's meteorological and climate change monitoring capabilities. The ISMP is also a valuable example of the successful cooperation between IMD and ISRO.


## In addition to the above, the ISMP is also involved in a number of other important activities, such as:

* Developing new satellite-based meteorological products and services.
* Providing training to IMD staff on the use of satellite data for weather forecasting and climate monitoring.
* Collaborating with other national and international organizations on satellite meteorology research and development.

The ISMP is a dynamic and growing program, and it is committed to providing India with the best possible satellite-based meteorological data and services.
