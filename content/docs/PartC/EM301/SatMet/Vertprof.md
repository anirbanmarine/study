## How Vertical profiles of temperature and Humidity can be measured?

1. Vertical profiles of temperature and humidity from satellite pictures can be retrieved using a variety of methods. One common method is to use infrared sounders. Infrared sounders measure the amount of infrared radiation emitted by the atmosphere at different wavelengths. This information can be used to infer the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere at different altitudes.

2. Another method for retrieving vertical profiles of temperature and humidity from satellite pictures is to use microwave radiometers. Microwave radiometers measure the amount of microwave radiation emitted by the atmosphere at different wavelengths. This information can also be used to infer the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere at different altitudes.

3. A third method for retrieving vertical profiles of temperature and humidity from satellite pictures is to use a combination of infrared and microwave measurements. This method is often used to produce more accurate and detailed vertical profiles of temperature and humidity.

## How are vertical profiles of temperatures used?

Once vertical profiles of temperature and humidity have been retrieved from satellite pictures, they can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

1. **Weather forecasting:** Vertical profiles of temperature and humidity are used in weather forecasting models to predict the formation and movement of weather systems.

2. **Climate monitoring:** Vertical profiles of temperature and humidity are used to monitor climate change. By monitoring vertical profiles of temperature and humidity over time, scientists can track how the Earth's climate is changing.

3. **Atmospheric research:** Vertical profiles of temperature and humidity are used for a variety of atmospheric research purposes, such as studying the dynamics of the atmosphere and the formation of clouds.

## Here are some specific examples of how vertical profiles of temperature and humidity from satellite pictures are used:

1. To forecast the intensity of hurricanes. Vertical profiles of temperature and humidity can be used to forecast the intensity of hurricanes by providing information about the amount of energy available to fuel the storm.

2. To monitor the development of thunderstorms. Vertical profiles of temperature and humidity can be used to monitor the development of thunderstorms by identifying areas where the atmosphere is unstable and thunderstorms are likely to form.

3. To study the impact of climate change on the atmosphere. Vertical profiles of temperature and humidity can be used to study the impact of climate change on the atmosphere by tracking changes in the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere over time.

Vertical profiles of temperature and humidity from satellite pictures are an important tool for meteorologists and climate scientists. They provide valuable information about the atmosphere and its dynamics.
