## What is UNFSA?

The United Nations Agreement on the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (UNFSA) is an international agreement that aims to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.

Straddling fish stocks are those that occur both within the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of coastal states and in the high seas. Highly migratory fish stocks are those that migrate across the EEZs of two or more coastal states or extend into the high seas.

**UNFSA was adopted in 1995 and entered into force in 2001.*** It is currently one of the most important international agreements governing fisheries management.

## UNFSA sets out a number of principles and obligations for states in relation to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. These include:

* The precautionary approach: States must act with caution when taking decisions that could have a negative impact on straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, even if there is no scientific certainty that such an impact will occur.
* The best available scientific information: States must base their decisions on the best available scientific information.
* Compatibility: States must ensure that their conservation and management measures are compatible with those of other states that are fishing the same stocks.
* Transparency: States must be transparent about their conservation and management measures and the data on which they are based.

### What are RFMOs?

UNFSA also establishes a number of mechanisms for cooperation between states, including through regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs). RFMOs are responsible for developing and implementing conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in their respective regions.

UNFSA has played an important role in improving the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. However, there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed. These include:

### Overfishing: 

Overfishing remains a major problem for many straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.

### Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing: 

IUU fishing is also a major problem, and it undermines the effectiveness of conservation and management measures.

### Climate change: 

Climate change is having a significant impact on straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, and it is making it more difficult to manage them sustainably.

Despite these challenges, UNFSA remains an essential tool for the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. States must continue to work together to implement the provisions of UNFSA and to address the challenges that lie ahead.
