## What is ABNJ?

Areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) are those parts of the ocean that are not under the control of any one country. They cover about 64% of the ocean's surface and 95% of its volume, making them the largest global commons on Earth.

ABNJ are home to a wide range of marine life and ecosystems, including many that are unique and found nowhere else on the planet. They also play a vital role in regulating the climate and providing essential resources to people around the world.

However, ABNJ are facing a number of challenges, including overfishing, pollution, and climate change. These challenges are interconnected and require a coordinated response from the global community.

The conservation and management of resources in ABNJ is governed by a number of international agreements, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). These agreements provide a framework for cooperation on a range of issues, including fisheries, shipping, and environmental protection.

In addition to international agreements, there are also a number of regional and subregional organizations that play a role in the conservation and management of ABNJ resources. These organizations work to coordinate management efforts and develop common standards and practices.

## Despite the existence of these agreements and organizations, there are still a number of challenges to the effective conservation and management of ABNJ resources. These challenges include:

* The fragmentation of the international ocean governance system
* The lack of effective enforcement mechanisms for international agreements
* The capacity constraints of developing countries
* The increasing pressure on marine resources from human activities


Despite these challenges, there is a growing recognition of the importance of ABNJ conservation and management. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 calls for "conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development."

## There are a number of things that can be done to improve the conservation and management of ABNJ resources, including:

1. Strengthening international cooperation and coordination 
2. Improving the enforcement of international agreements
3. Building capacity in developing countries
4. Promoting sustainable ocean-based economies

Raising public awareness of the importance of ABNJ conservation and sustainable use
Here are some specific examples of conservation and management measures that are being implemented in ABNJ:

### Fishery management: 

Regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) have been established to manage fisheries in ABNJ. RFMOs set catch limits, establish fishing seasons, and implement other measures to ensure the sustainable management of fish stocks.

### Marine protected areas: 

Marine protected areas (MPAs) can be used to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems and biodiversity in ABNJ. MPAs can be established through international agreements or by individual countries.

### Pollution prevention and control: 

A number of international agreements are in place to prevent and control pollution in ABNJ. These agreements address a range of pollutants, including oil, sewage, and hazardous substances.

### Climate change adaptation: 

The impacts of climate change are already being felt in ABNJ, and these impacts are expected to become more severe in the future. A number of international organizations and initiatives are working to help countries adapt to the impacts of climate change in ABNJ.

The conservation and management of ABNJ resources is a complex and challenging task. However, it is essential that we find ways to manage these resources sustainably for the benefit of current and future generations.
