## What is CCRF?
The FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF) is a voluntary international instrument that sets out principles and standards for the conservation, management and development of living aquatic resources. It was adopted by the FAO Conference in 1995 and has since been endorsed by over 180 countries.

## The CCRF is based on the following principles:

### The precautionary approach: 

States should act with caution when taking decisions that could have a negative impact on living aquatic resources, even if there is no scientific certainty that such an impact will occur.

### Ecosystem approach: 

States should manage living aquatic resources in a way that takes into account the interconnectedness of ecosystems and the need to protect biodiversity.

### Good governance: 

States should develop and implement policies and measures for the conservation, management and development of living aquatic resources in a participatory and transparent manner.

### Sustainable use: 

States should ensure that living aquatic resources are used in a sustainable manner, so that they can be used for present and future generations.

## The CCRF covers a wide range of issues, including:

### Fisheries management: 

The CCRF provides guidance on how to develop and implement effective fisheries management measures.

### Aquaculture: 

The CCRF provides guidance on how to develop and implement sustainable aquaculture practices.

### Research and development: 

The CCRF emphasizes the importance of research and development in supporting the conservation, management and development of living aquatic resources.

### International cooperation: 

The CCRF encourages states to cooperate with each other on the conservation, management and development of shared living aquatic resources.

The CCRF is a valuable tool for governments, fishers, aquaculture operators, and other stakeholders involved in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. It provides a framework for responsible and sustainable practices that can help to ensure the long-term health of living aquatic resources and the benefits they provide to people around the world.

## Here are some examples of how the CCRF is being implemented:

* In many countries, the CCRF has been used to develop national fisheries management plans.
* The CCRF has also been used to develop regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs), which are responsible for managing shared fish stocks.
* In the aquaculture sector, the CCRF has been used to develop standards for sustainable aquaculture practices.
* The CCRF is also being used to promote international cooperation on fisheries and aquaculture issues.
* The CCRF is not a legally binding instrument, but it is a highly respected and influential document. It has played an important role in raising awareness of the need for responsible fisheries and aquaculture practices.
