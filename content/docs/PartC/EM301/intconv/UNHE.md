The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, also known as the Stockholm Conference, was held in Stockholm, Sweden, from June 5-16, 1972. It was the first major international conference to address environmental issues.

The conference was attended by representatives from 113 countries, and resulted in the adoption of the Stockholm Declaration, an Action Plan for the Human Environment, and several resolutions.

The Stockholm Declaration is a landmark document in environmental law. It contains 26 principles that outline the rights and responsibilities of states in protecting the environment. Some of the key principles of the Stockholm Declaration include:

* Man has the fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate conditions of life, in an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well-being.
* States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.
* The natural resources of the earth, including air, water, land, flora and fauna and especially representative samples of natural ecosystems, must be safeguarded for the benefit of present and future generations through careful planning or management, as appropriate.
* The Action Plan for the Human Environment is a comprehensive document that sets out a series of recommendations for addressing environmental problems at the national and international levels. The plan includes recommendations on a wide range of issues, including pollution control, natural resource management, and environmental education.

The Stockholm Conference was a watershed moment in the global environmental movement.
