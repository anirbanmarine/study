##Rio+10

The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), also known as Rio+10, was held in Johannesburg, South Africa, from 26 August to 4 September 2002. It was a follow-up to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The Rio+10 Summit was attended by over 100 heads of state and government, as well as representatives from civil society and the private sector. It focused on the implementation of the outcomes of the 1992 Earth Summit, and on identifying new challenges and opportunities for sustainable development.

The Rio+10 Summit produced a number of outcomes, including:

* The Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development, which reaffirmed the commitment of world leaders to sustainable development and set out a number of goals and targets to be achieved by 2015.
* The Plan of Implementation, which provided a detailed blueprint for implementing the Johannesburg Declaration.
* The Type II Partnerships, which were voluntary agreements between governments, businesses, and civil society organizations to work together on specific sustainable development projects.

The Rio+10 Summit was a significant event in the history of sustainable development. It helped to raise awareness of the importance of sustainable development and to mobilize global action on the issue. However, it is important to note that many of the goals and targets set at the Rio+10 Summit were not achieved, and that the world still faces a number of challenges in achieving sustainable development.

##Rio+20

The 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), also known as Rio+20, was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 20 to 22 June 2012. It was a follow-up to the 1992 Earth Summit and the 2002 Rio+10 Summit.

The Rio+20 Conference was attended by over 100 heads of state and government, as well as representatives from civil society and the private sector. It focused on the following three themes:

Green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication.
Institutional framework for sustainable development.
The new challenges of sustainable development.
The Rio+20 Conference produced a number of outcomes, including:

* The Future We Want, an outcome document that reaffirmed the commitment of world leaders to sustainable development and set out a number of goals and targets to be achieved.
* The 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP), which provided a framework for international cooperation on sustainable consumption and production.
* The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), an independent intergovernmental body to assess the state of biodiversity.

The Rio+20 Conference was a significant event in the history of sustainable development. It helped to renew the commitment of world leaders to sustainable development and to lay the foundation for a new era of sustainable development. However, it is important to note that many of the goals and targets set at the Rio+20 Conference have not yet been achieved, and that the world still faces a number of challenges in achieving sustainable development.

## Legacy of Rio+10 and Rio+20

The Rio+10 and Rio+20 Summits were important events in the history of sustainable development. They helped to raise awareness of the importance of sustainable development, to mobilize global action on the issue, and to lay the foundation for a new era of sustainable development.

However, it is important to note that many of the goals and targets set at the Rio+10 and Rio+20 Summits have not yet been achieved. The world still faces a number of challenges in achieving sustainable development, including:

* Poverty and inequality
* Climate change
* Biodiversity loss
* Pollution
* Resource scarcity
Despite these challenges, there is also a growing awareness of the importance of sustainable development and a growing commitment to achieving it. The Rio+10 and Rio+20 Summits played an important role in promoting sustainable development, and their legacy continues to inspire people around the world to work towards a more sustainable future.
