The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), also known as the Earth Summit, was a major United Nations conference held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from June 3 to 14, 1992. It was the largest gathering of world leaders as of 1992, with 117 heads of state and representatives of 178 nations in all attending.

The Earth Summit was convened in recognition of the growing interdependence of the environment and development. It was a landmark event in the history of international environmental cooperation, and it produced a number of important agreements, including:

The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, which sets out 27 principles for sustainable development, including the principle that "human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development."
The Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is the main international treaty for addressing climate change.
The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which is the main international treaty for addressing the loss of biodiversity.
Agenda 21, a comprehensive plan for sustainable development that covers a wide range of issues, including poverty, hunger, health, education, and environmental protection.
The Earth Summit was a major step forward in international environmental cooperation, but it is important to note that the agreements it produced are not legally binding. This means that countries are not obligated to implement them, but they do provide a framework for international action on sustainable development.

The Earth Summit also had a significant impact on public awareness of environmental issues. It helped to put sustainable development on the global agenda and to inspire people around the world to take action to protect the environment.

The 30th anniversary of the Earth Summit will be celebrated in 2022. This is an opportunity to reflect on the progress that has been made in the past 30 years and to identify the challenges that remain. It is also an opportunity to renew our commitment to sustainable development and to build a better future for all.
