The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an international treaty that was adopted in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It entered into force in 1994 and has been ratified by 198 countries, including India.

The UNFCCC is a landmark agreement that sets out the global framework for addressing climate change. It recognizes that climate change is a common concern of humankind and that all countries have a responsibility to address it. However, it also acknowledges that countries have different capabilities and responsibilities in addressing climate change, and that developed countries should take the lead.

The UNFCCC has two main objectives:

* To stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.
* To achieve this objective within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.

The UNFCCC is implemented through a number of mechanisms, including:

* National communications: Parties to the UNFCCC are required to submit national communications on a regular basis. These communications provide information on greenhouse gas emissions, mitigation and adaptation measures, and financial and technological needs.
* Conference of the Parties (COP): The COP is the supreme decision-making body of the UNFCCC. It meets every year to review the implementation of the Convention and to make decisions on new initiatives.
* Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTA): SBSTA is a scientific advisory body that provides advice to the COP on scientific, technical, and technological matters related to the UNFCCC.
* Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI): SBI is an implementation advisory body that provides advice to the COP on the implementation of the UNFCCC.
* The UNFCCC has played an important role in promoting international cooperation on climate change. However, there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and providing financial and technological support to developing countries to help them adapt to the impacts of climate change.

Here are some of the key achievements of the UNFCCC:

* The UNFCCC has helped to raise awareness of the importance of climate change and the need to address it.
* The UNFCCC has established a global framework for international cooperation on climate change.
* The UNFCCC has promoted the development of national climate change policies and plans.
* The UNFCCC has helped to mobilize financial and technological resources to support developing countries in their efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
* The UNFCCC is an important tool for addressing climate change. It is essential that all parties continue to work together to implement the Convention effectively.
