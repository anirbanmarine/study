The Intergovernmental Conference on biological diversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) concluded on June 19, 2023, with the adoption of a landmark agreement to conserve and sustainably use marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ). The agreement, which was adopted by consensus by the 193 member states of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), is the first comprehensive international treaty to address marine biodiversity in ABNJ.

The BBNJ agreement covers a wide range of issues, including:

>* Marine protected areas (MPAs): The agreement establishes a process for establishing and managing MPAs in ABNJ, including large-scale MPAs.
>* Environmental impact assessments (EIAs): The agreement requires EIAs to be conducted for all activities that have the potential to significantly impact marine biodiversity in ABNJ.
>* Capacity building and technology transfer: The agreement includes provisions to help developing countries build their capacity to implement the agreement and to gain access to relevant technologies.

The BBNJ agreement is a significant achievement for the conservation of marine biodiversity. It is estimated that ABNJ accounts for over half of the Earth's surface and is home to a vast array of marine life, much of which is still unknown to science. The agreement will help to protect this biodiversity from the growing threats of climate change, overfishing, and pollution.



## Current status of the BBNJ agreement

As of October 1, 2023, the BBNJ agreement has been signed by 92 countries and regional economic integration organizations. However, it has not yet been ratified by any country.

### Significance of the BBNJ agreement

The BBNJ agreement is a significant achievement for the conservation of marine biodiversity. It is the first comprehensive international treaty to address marine biodiversity in ABNJ, which covers over half of the Earth's surface. The agreement will help to protect this biodiversity from the growing threats of climate change, overfishing, and pollution.

The BBNJ agreement is also significant because it was adopted by consensus by the 193 member states of UNCLOS. This shows that there is a strong international commitment to conserving marine biodiversity in ABNJ.

### Next steps

The next step for the BBNJ agreement is for countries to ratify it. Once 30 countries have ratified the agreement, it will enter into force.

Countries are encouraged to ratify the BBNJ agreement as soon as possible to ensure that its benefits can be realized as soon as possible.
