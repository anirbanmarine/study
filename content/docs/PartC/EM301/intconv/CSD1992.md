The Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) was a functional commission of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) that was established in 1992 following the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The CSD was tasked with reviewing the implementation of Agenda 21, the global plan for sustainable development that was adopted at the Earth Summit.

>The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is an international financial institution that was established in 1992 to provide >funding for projects that address global environmental problems. The GEF is one of the financial mechanisms of the CSD, >and it plays an important role in supporting the implementation of Agenda 21.

The GEF provides funding for projects in a number of areas, including:

* Climate change
* Biodiversity
* International waters
* Land degradation
* Chemicals and waste
* Persistent organic pollutants (POPs)

The GEF works with a variety of partners, including governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector, to implement its projects.

The CSD was abolished in 2013 and its functions were transferred to the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The HLPF is the global forum for reviewing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The GEF continues to play an important role in supporting the implementation of the SDGs. It is the largest provider of grants to developing countries for environmental projects.

Here are some examples of how the GEF has supported the implementation of Agenda 21:

* The GEF has provided funding for projects to protect and restore forests, which play an important role in mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity.
* The GEF has provided funding for projects to improve water quality and management, which is essential for human health and sustainable development.
* The GEF has provided funding for projects to reduce pollution and protect the environment from hazardous chemicals and waste.
* The GEF is a key partner in the global effort to achieve sustainable development. It plays an important role in supporting the implementation of Agenda 21 and the SDGs.
