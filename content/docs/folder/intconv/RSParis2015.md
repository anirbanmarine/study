The Regional Seas Programme (RSP) is a global partnership of 14 Regional Seas Conventions and Action Plans (RSCAPs) that work to protect and manage the marine and coastal environment. The RSP is coordinated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and is funded by a variety of sources, including governments, international organizations, and the private sector.

The RSP was launched in 1974 at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm. The first RSCAP was established in the Mediterranean Sea in 1976, and since then, RSCAPs have been established in all major ocean regions around the world.

The RSP takes an ecosystem-based approach to marine and coastal management. This means that it takes into account the interconnectedness of all components of the marine and coastal environment, including humans. The RSP works to protect and manage the marine and coastal environment through a variety of activities, including:

Developing and implementing regional action plans to address specific marine and coastal environmental problems
Providing technical assistance and capacity building to developing countries
Promoting public awareness and education about marine and coastal environmental issues
Facilitating cooperation and coordination between different stakeholders
The RSP has played a significant role in protecting and managing the marine and coastal environment. It has helped to reduce pollution, protect biodiversity, and promote sustainable development in coastal communities.

In Paris 2015, the RSP was recognized as an important tool for implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are a set of 17 goals adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.

The RSP is particularly relevant to the following SDGs:

SDG 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development
SDG 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
The RSP is committed to working with all stakeholders to implement the SDGs and achieve a more sustainable future for the marine and coastal environment.
