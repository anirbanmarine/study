The London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (LC 1972) is a global treaty adopted in 1972 to protect the marine environment from human activities, including the dumping of wastes. The Convention entered into force in 1975 and currently has 87 Contracting Parties.

The London Convention prohibits the dumping of certain hazardous materials, such as organohalogen compounds, mercury, cadmium, persistent plastics, and radioactive wastes. It also requires a prior special permit for the dumping of certain other materials, such as industrial wastes and dredged material.

In 1996, the London Protocol was adopted to further modernize the Convention and, eventually, replace it. The Protocol prohibits all dumping, except for possibly acceptable wastes on the so-called "reverse list". The London Protocol entered into force in 2006 and currently has 52 Contracting Parties.

The London Convention and Protocol play an important role in protecting the marine environment from pollution caused by dumping. By prohibiting or regulating the dumping of certain wastes, the Conventions help to ensure that the oceans remain clean and healthy for future generations.

>Here are some of the key achievements of the London Convention and Protocol:
>* The dumping of radioactive wastes at sea has been banned since 1993.
>* The dumping of industrial wastes at sea was phased out by 1995.
>* The incineration of wastes at sea has been banned since 1994.
>* The dumping of persistent plastics at sea has been prohibited since 2010.
>* The London Convention and Protocol have helped to reduce the amount of marine debris, such as plastic bags and bottles, in the oceans.
>* The Conventions have also helped to improve the quality of seawater and seabed sediments in many parts of the world.

The London Convention and Protocol are important tools for protecting the marine environment from pollution caused by dumping. By working together, the Contracting Parties to the Conventions can help to ensure that the oceans remain clean and healthy for all.
