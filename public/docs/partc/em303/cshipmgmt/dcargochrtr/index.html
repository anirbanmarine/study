<main><h1>Dry Cargo chartering</h1>
<p>Dry cargo chartering is the process of negotiating and agreeing to a contract for the carriage of dry cargo by sea. Dry cargo charter parties can be complex and vary depending on the specific terms agreed upon by the charterer and shipowner. However, there are some common features of dry cargo charter parties.</p>
<p><strong>Types of dry cargo charter parties</strong></p>
<p>There are two main types of dry cargo charter parties: voyage charter parties and time charter parties.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Voyage charter parties:</strong> Voyage charter parties are agreements for the carriage of a specific quantity of cargo from one port to another. The charterer pays the shipowner a freight rate, which is typically calculated based on the amount of cargo transported and the distance traveled.</li>
<li><strong>Time charter parties:</strong> Time charter parties are agreements for the charterer to have the use of a ship for a specific period of time. The charterer pays the shipowner a time charter rate, which is typically calculated based on the size of the ship and the duration of the charter.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="common-terms-in-dry-cargo-charter-parties">Common terms in dry cargo charter parties</h2>
<p>Some of the common terms in dry cargo charter parties include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Freight rate:</strong> The freight rate is the price that the charterer pays to the shipowner for the carriage of the cargo.</li>
<li><strong>Laytime:</strong> Laytime is the amount of time that the charterer has to load and discharge the cargo.</li>
<li><strong>Demurrage:</strong> Demurrage is a charge that the charterer pays to the shipowner for each day that the laytime is exceeded.</li>
<li><strong>Despatch:</strong> Despatch is a bonus that the shipowner pays to the charterer for each day that the laytime is saved.</li>
<li><strong>Loading and discharging ports:</strong> The loading and discharging ports are the ports where the cargo will be loaded and discharged.</li>
<li><strong>Cargo specifications:</strong> The cargo specifications include the type of cargo, the quantity of cargo, and the condition of the cargo.</li>
<li><strong>War risk insurance:</strong> War risk insurance is insurance that protects the shipowner and charterer from losses caused by war or other hostilities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="negotiating-a-dry-cargo-charter-party">Negotiating a dry cargo charter party</h2>
<p>The negotiation of a dry cargo charter party can be complex and time-consuming. The charterer and shipowner will need to negotiate the terms of the charter party, such as the freight rate, laytime, demurrage, and despatch. The charterer will also need to provide the shipowner with the cargo specifications and arrange for war risk insurance.</p>
<p>Once the terms of the charter party have been agreed upon, the charterer and shipowner will need to sign the charter party. The charter party will then be legally binding on both parties.</p>

<h2 id="dry-bulk-shipping"><strong>Dry Bulk Shipping</strong></h2>
<p>Dry bulk trades have been transformed over the past three decades. The average size of ships engaged in dry bulk trades has doubled in size. Dry bulk trades have in fact evolved from the tramp shipping market. Tramp markets were served by small, general-purpose ships. Historically, general-purpose ships were steaming the ports in search of business, spot market cargoes. Shipowners use a global network of shipbrokers to seek cargoes for their ships. Shipbrokers perform a fundamental function in providing information to both shipowners and charterers. As cargo lot sizes and ship sizes have increased, there is a tendency for significant charterers to use long time charters, consecutive voyage charters, and contracts of affreightment. Despite the growth in these types of contracts, there is still a huge volume of spot charters and spot ship chartering is a very competitive market.</p>
<p>The dry cargo market can be defined using two basic methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tramp Ship</li>
<li>Tramp Market Characteristics</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tramp Ship</strong></p>
<p>In 1959, Hector Gripaios defined the tramp ship as a “deep-sea tramp ship carry any cargo between any port at any time, always providing that the venture is both legal and safe”. In 1972, Prof. Metaxas’ book “The Economics of Tramp Shipping” was published. Prof. Metaxas defined the tramp ship as “ship with a tonnage of 4,000 DWT or above, which in the long-run does not have a fixed itinerary, and which carries mainly dry cargo in bulk over relatively long distances and from one or more ports to one or more ports is an ocean or deep sea tramp”. Both tramp ship definitions emphasize the fact that tramp ships have <strong>no</strong> fixed pattern of employment. The minimum ship size and deep-sea nature of the tramp ship is introduced by Prof. Metaxas.</p>
<p><strong>Tramp Market Characteristics</strong></p>
<p>Defining the dry cargo market with specific ship characteristics have some drawbacks. In the dry bulk shipping market, cargo volumes and average lot sizes have increased since the 1970s. Hence, the average size of most ship types dramatically increased. Modern dry bulk ships are more specialized than the old tramps and dry bulk ship size reached up to 400,000 DWT. On the other hand, larger ships require larger capital requirements, shipowners are only prepared to risk the commitment to such large ships if shipowners have long-term contracts. Handysize, handymax, panamax, capesize bulk carriers are more specialized and are often employed on contracts of affreightment (COA). Contracts of affreightment (COA) permits the shipowner to meet the charterer’s requirements by using more than one ship. The modern definition of the dry bulk market would need to include the development of these long-term contracts. Freight rates for these long-term contracts are still influenced by the spot market. Dry cargo definition that is based upon market characteristics might be more applicable.</p>
<p>In dry cargo markets, most shipping contracts between charterers and shipowners become well known to all the market participants through <strong>shipbroking companies</strong>. Therefore, all participants in dry cargo markets know the prevailing levels of freight rates and can make decisions accordingly.</p>
<p>Dry cargo markets include many types of contracts such as spot fixtures, consecutive voyages, contracts of affreightment (COA), time charters. Dry cargo markets’ clearest definition may be found in the market characteristics rather than in the particular specification of the ship.</p>
<p>The dry bulk freight market is a very competitive market and very close to the perfectly competitive market model. Important features of a perfectly competitive market model:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every supplier seeks to maximize profits</li>
<li>Numerous buyers and sellers in the market</li>
<li>The service offered by each shipping company is exactly the same as every other company</li>
<li>Easy exit from and entry to the market.</li>
<li>Full information is available to all participants in the market place</li>
</ol>
<p>The dry cargo market fulfills all of the features of a perfectly competitive market model. Shipowners and charterers seek to maximize their profits. A large number of shipowners and charterers in the dry bulk market. No single shipowner or single charterer of the dry bulk market can influence the behavior of freight rates. Dry bulk freight rates cannot be fixed. Dry bulk freight rates are driven by overall demand and supply conditions. All shipping companies in the dry bulk market offer the same service, same cargo space, and safe transportation of cargo in a timely manner. Assuming that the analysis is based on ships of an acceptable standard. Entry and exit from the dry bulk market are fairly easy. Easy does <strong>not</strong> mean costless. A person can enter the dry bulk market by buying a secondhand ship or by ordering a newbuilding ship and becomes a shipowner. New shipowners would not suffer a cost disadvantage from entering the dry bulk market. On the other hand, if the shipowner earns unsatisfactory profits and sees no long-term prospects for recovery, then the shipowner can put the ship up for sale and exit dry bulk market. If the shipowner would incur a loss when selling the ship, this could be a barrier to exiting. If many shipowners cannot make profits, and buyers are few, shipowners can either lay up or scrap the ship. If the ship is scrapped, a dry bulk market exit occurs. Entry and exit are easy in dry bulk market because existing shipowners have no way of preventing such a process. In the dry bulk market, full market information is available to all participants by Baltic Exchange. <strong>Shipbrokers</strong> act as information transmitters. Shipbrokers ensure that all dry bulk market players are kept fully informed of any event that might affect the market.</p>
<p>One crucial characteristic of a competitive dry bulk market is that shipowners have <strong>no individual influence</strong> over market freight rates. Profit is made in the margin between revenues and costs. The only element that shipowners have control over cost. Competitive markets tend to be driven by cost trends, rather than by demand features.</p>
<p><strong>Dry Bulk Market Trends Over the Past 30 Years</strong></p>
<p>Over the past 30 years, the <strong>total volume of cargo</strong> has more than doubled at an annual average compound <strong>growth rate</strong> of <strong>4.5%</strong> per year. Demand growth is much more <strong>uneven</strong> on a year-to-year basis over the past 30 years. The highest rate of growth to be observed occurred in 2010, at <strong>12.1%</strong>. 2010 growth rate is about three times the long-term average. Since 1995, <strong>ship tonnage growth</strong> rate has fluctuated between -2.8% and 12.1%. Over the past 30 years, shipping demand growth tends to move in cycles of good years, medium years, poor years, and back again. In other words, freight rates rate peaks, declines, becomes negative, recovers again. Shipping cycles exist around a rising trend in the total volume of cargo moved.</p>
<p>In the period 1999-2015, the growth rate of <strong>tonne-mile</strong> demand has varied between -2.7% and 13. 1%. In the period 1999-2015, <strong>tonne-mile</strong> demand increased by <strong>5.2%</strong> per year compound, on the other hand, <strong>cargo tonnes</strong> moved grew by <strong>4.5%</strong> per year. Differences in the growth of tonnage demand and tonne-mile demand imply that journey distances have fluctuated. The average haul has declined from 5,508 miles in 1999 to 5,437 in 2015. In the period 1999-2015, the growth rate of the <strong>dry bulk fleet</strong> has averaged <strong>5.7%</strong> per year. In sum, between 1999-2015, supply capacity has exceeded demand. Ship supply capacity should properly be measured in terms of <strong>tonne-mile</strong>. Furthermore, the laid-up fleet has been steadily declining since 1992.</p>
<p><strong>Cost Structure of Tramp Ship Operators</strong></p>
<p>Tramp ship operators have to identify and split their costs between <strong>fixed</strong> and <strong>variable</strong> costs in the short run. In the shipping business, most variable costs related to producing shipping output, in other words undertaking a voyage. The distinction between avoidable (variable) and unavoidable (fixed) costs is also useful when making operational decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Ship Lay-up Decision</strong></p>
<p>Tramp ship operators to lay up a ship or to continue to trade is a complex decision. If the trip loses money i.e. freight revenues are less than the total costs, then the ship could not be laid up. Because lay-up is <strong>not</strong> a costless activity, lay-up costs money. During the lay-up, some costs will be reduced. On the other hand, the ship has to be maintained, provided with some power, anchored safe lay-up position, and skeleton crew provisions must be provided. Unavoidable (fixed) costs will be incurred by the shipowner whether the ship trades or lays-up. Fixed costs are common in both situations whether the ship trades or lays-up. Hence, fixed costs <strong>cannot</strong> affect the outcome of the lay-up decision. For example, the shipowner estimates that daily operating costs are $12,000 for a ship in a trading condition and $5,000 in lay-up. $4,000 of this cost is assumed to be the capital cost of owning the ship. Capital cost is a fixed cost and unavoidable. Therefore, capital costs can be canceled out. Relevant costs become $8,000 per day when trading and $1,000 per day when laid up. Assume that the shipowner is now offered a voyage business which takes 40 days and voyage-related costs of $400,000 in the period. On a total cost basis, the owner will require $880,000 in revenues. If the ship has a 44,000 DWT carrying capacity, this implies a rate of $20 per tonne of cargo delivered. But suppose the market rate is only $18. Should the shipowner lay up the ship?. If the shipowner lays up the ship, the shipowner faces extra costs of $40,000 (40 days x $1,000 lay-up costs per day). If shipowner takes business, shipowner gain $792,000 ($18 x 44,000 metric tons ) in extra revenues . But they spend operating costs of ($8,000 x 40 days) + $400,000 = $720,000. Therefore, the shipowner gains $72,000, compared to the loss of $40,000 resulting from lay-up. Shipowners should take a voyage charter business, even though the rate is less than the full cost of the trip. On the other hand, the same conclusion would be reached if the capital costs of $4,000 per day had been included. Here above example ignored any additional lay-up costs itself. Including lay-up costs would emphasize that trading will often take place at market rates which are less than the long-run costs.</p>
<p>In order to decide to lay up a ship, the shipowner should develop a model of the <strong>breakeven</strong> <strong>level of freight rates</strong> needed to maintain trading. Here above hypothetical lay-up example has implicitly assumed that the shipping company has <strong>one</strong> ship in operation. On the other hand, a large number of dry shipowners operate large fleets. As the number of ships operated by a company increases, unit costs decrease. Tramp operators tend to have a higher proportion of their costs as <strong>variable costs</strong> when compared to liner ship operators.</p>
<p>The distinction between <strong>short-run</strong> fixed and variable costs is <strong>not</strong> clear cut. <strong>Short-run</strong> fixed and variable costs depend on:</p>
<ul>
<li>nature of the problem</li>
<li>type of ship</li>
<li>time period</li>
</ul>
<p>Here above lay-up example, some items of <strong>daily operating costs</strong> could be avoided (variable costs). On the other hand, if the shipowner was considering between two trading options, the entire daily running cost could <strong>not</strong> be avoided and becomes a fixed cost. Shorter the time period under consideration, the greater the proportion of costs that will be <strong>fixed costs</strong>. Once a ship is at its loading berth (voyage is commenced), practically <strong>all costs</strong> become <strong>fixed costs</strong> (unavoidable).</p>
<p><strong>Breakeven Analysis in Determining Minimum Freight Rates</strong></p>
<p>In order to determine the minimum freight rates, breakeven analysis is a very well-known method to present information on revenue and costs. In the breakeven analysis, the normal procedure is to calculate the <strong>load factor</strong> (level of utilization) required to <strong>breakeven</strong> <strong>point</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Profit: actual load factor (utilization level) exceeds the calculated number</li>
<li>Loss: actual load factor (utilization level) below the calculated number</li>
</ul>
<p>In liner shipping, ships operate on a timetable and liner ships have to sail whether or not ships are fully loaded. Therefore, defining the load factor (utilization level) may well be significant in liner shipping. On the other hand, usually in dry bulk shipping, dry bulk ships are full cargo loaded (high utilization levels). Dry bulk ships do not operate on a timetable and sail whether or not they are fully loaded.</p>
<p>Instead of applying the model to working out the breakeven load factor, it can instead be employed to work out the <strong>breakeven rate.</strong> The Breakeven rate is the freight rate which will ensure that a <strong>full cargo load</strong> will generate sufficient <strong>revenue</strong> to cover costs. Dry bulk freight rates are quite volatile. Therefore, it is useful to calculate the <strong>minimum freight rate</strong> required to <strong>breakeven</strong> the <strong>point</strong>.</p>
<p>Freight Rates Breakeven Analysis is based on the following assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The basic unit of analysis is the ship</li>
<li>Costs and revenues are assumed to be <strong>linear</strong></li>
<li>Plentiful market players. Shipowners and charterers <strong>cannot</strong> influence the market freight rate on their own.</li>
<li>The actual freight rate is taken as fixed since no individual has any ability to alter freight rates. Market players are price takers</li>
</ol>
<p>The slope of the Total Revenue line represents the market price; since total revenues rise in line with volume carried, the price is constant all the way along the Total Revenue line. Total fixed costs are the same, no matter what cargo quantity is loaded. Total variable costs are the difference between total costs and total fixed costs. At the cargo quantity level (Q) where <strong>total revenue</strong> equals <strong>total cost</strong> (Total Cost = Total Revenue = Equilibrium Point) is the <strong>Breakeven Freight Rate</strong>. This cargo quantity (Q) is called the <strong>Breakeven Quantity</strong> because it is at this point that total revenues cover both variable and fixed costs.</p>
<p>In a shipping company, the <strong>lower</strong> the proportion of <strong>variable costs</strong> to <strong>fixed costs</strong>, the greater the scope for the <strong>freight rate</strong> to fall <strong>below</strong> the <strong>long-run total cost</strong>. This is one of the factors that explain the <strong>sharp</strong> <strong>fluctuations</strong> that are observed in freight rates in the dry cargo trades when contrasted with liner trades. Dry bulk companies have high variable costs, liner companies have high fixed costs. In depressed markets, dry bulk shipowners may well accept <strong>short-run trip charters</strong> at rates well <strong>below</strong> those required to cover their <strong>long-run costs</strong>, if the proportion of variable costs are low.</p>
<p><strong>Modeling Dry Cargo Shipping Market</strong></p>
<p>The shipping market can be separated into specific segments. During modeling and analyzing the dry cargo shipping market, the following assumptions are made:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each shipowner is seeking to <strong>maximize profits</strong> (or minimize losses)</li>
<li>Each charterer is seeking the <strong>lowest freight rate</strong> (consistent with an acceptable quality of service offered by the shipowner)</li>
<li>A large number of fixtures and all market participants are informed</li>
<li>Perfect competition</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a downward-sloping relationship between the <strong>cargo volumes</strong> required to be moved and the level of <strong>freight rates</strong>, other things being equal. The higher the freight rate, the smaller the demand for cargo movements and vice versa. Demand for dry cargo tonne-miles is a <strong>derived demand</strong>. <strong>Derived demand price elasticity</strong> basic principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Final products’ price elasticity</li>
<li>Existence of close substitutes</li>
<li>The proportion of transport costs in the final product</li>
</ul>
<p>Derived demand price elasticity example: grain. Grain movements are driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production trends in different regions of the world</li>
<li>Drought, weather conditions, and crop yields</li>
<li>Changing patterns of food consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>Grain is used to making bread, pasta. Furthermore, the grain is used to feed animals to produce meat. Final products such as bread, pasta, meat all have a <strong>low price elasticity</strong> of demand. Most empirical evidence suggests that bread, pasta, meat are <strong>price inelastic</strong>. Major grain exporters are located in South America, US Gulf, and Australia. Therefore, grain has to be moved by sea, because air transport is a very expensive alternative and not feasible. Currently, freight rates are about 6% of the final price of most traded commodities. Market demand is likely to be <strong>extremely inelastic</strong> with respect to changes in freight rates. The shipping demand curve can be represented as an almost <strong>vertical line</strong>. An extremely inelastic shipping market conclusion is for the shipping market as a <strong>whole</strong>. In some trade routes, the demand on that route might be more sensitive to changes in that route’s freight rate. Shipowners always seek out trade routes that are more profitable. On the other hand, the ability to switch a ship from one route to another at relatively short notice implies that freight rates should not get too out of line with each other.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping Supply</strong></p>
<p>In the dry bulk shipping business, under competitive conditions, shipowners <strong>should never</strong> accept <strong>a freight rate</strong> that is <strong>less</strong> than the <strong>Average Variable Cost</strong> <strong>(AVC)</strong>. Furthermore, <strong>different ships have different costs</strong>, because of different ages, flags, or crew costs. Assume that all average variable costs of all bulk carriers on the market were known and that a ranking could be organized starting with the dry cargo bulk ship with the lowest average variable cost to the highest. If shipping freight rates were high enough and cargo volumes large enough, all these dry bulk carriers would be employed. Now, if the shipping freight rate is steadily reduced, ships with high variable costs (avoidable) will cease trading first. As freight rate is lowered more, more dry bulk carriers are forced into idleness, until none is trading. <strong>Capital costs</strong> should <strong>play no role</strong> in the <strong>lay-up decision</strong> in the <strong>short run</strong> since capital costs have to be met whether or not the ship is being traded. Older ships will tend to have higher operating costs than newer ships, so the majority of laid-up ships are the older ships of the fleets. In the short-run period, ships’ variable costs can be altered by varying the ship’s speed. Lower ship speed means lower output and lower costs. When demand is low and so freight rates are low, the loss of shipping output is more than offset by the benefits of <strong>slow steaming</strong>. The shipping supply curve becomes steeper in slope as maximum tonne-mile production is attained. Because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional tonne-miles being created near full capacity are being created by the more inefficient ships in the fleet the ones with <strong>higher variable costs</strong>. High variable cost ships add a lot to costs without adding that much extra to output</li>
<li>Speed increases are a limited way of raising output. Extra costs of fuel consumption increase more rapidly than the extra output</li>
</ul>
<p>The shipping supply curve eventually becomes <strong>vertical</strong> which represents the notion of <strong>full capacity utilization</strong>. <strong>In the short term</strong>, no more shipping output can be obtained from the <strong>existing fleet</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Equilibrium Freight Rate</strong></p>
<p>The shipping market is defined as the interaction of supply and demand. Demand and supply both together determine the <strong>equilibrium freight rate</strong> (P) and quantities (Q) moved at that freight rate. Shipping demand conditions are affected by the volume of world trade, which is driven by overall economic activity, and changing degrees of openness towards trade by individual nations. As demand volumes increase, there is a relatively small rise in the market freight rate and a large rise in tonne-miles produced at the beginning. But, as demand volumes keep increasing, the increase in demand is translated into large increases in freight rates, because supply is very limited supply becomes very <strong>inelastic</strong>. This model can be used to examine <strong>short-run</strong> fluctuations in shipping market conditions, but <strong>not</strong> the <strong>long-run</strong> period. Because, in the <strong>short-run</strong> period, the existing stock of ships is limited. But, in the <strong>long-run</strong> period, altering the stock of ships (newbuilding and scrapped ships) shifts the equilibrium point. In the short-run period, when demand increase, freight rates move up very sharply and supply does <strong>not</strong> increase much. Existing shipowners make large profits and this situation encourages shipowners to <strong>order new ships</strong>. In the second-hand market, the value of existing ships also rises. Shipping market players expect that profits are going to be healthy in the future. Increased number of newbuilding orders will translate into a rightward shift in the supply curve in the <strong>long term</strong> and this will lead to a <strong>fall</strong> in freight rates if demand remains the same. In the short-run period, when demand decrease, this situation cause reduction in supply and a rise in ship <strong>lay-ups</strong>. In the short-run period, when some ships will be trading at freight rates which do <strong>not</strong> cover full costs. Operating slightly below variable costs is acceptable in the <strong>short-term</strong>, but it is <strong>not</strong> sustainable in the long-term. Therefore, some ships will be laid up or scrapped. The scrapping of ships leads to help raise freight rates if the supply shifts far enough.</p>
<p>Higher or lower <strong>freight rates</strong> create incentives to increase or to decrease <strong>tonne-miles</strong> supplied through the following mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>higher or lower freight rates encourage a higher or slower ship <strong>speed</strong></li>
<li>higher or lower freight rates will encourage shipowners with <strong>high variable cost ships</strong> to scrap or lay-up</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <strong>long-run</strong> period, <strong>fluctuations</strong> in freight rates and lay-up numbers encourage shipowners to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embrace or reject newbuilding orders</li>
<li>Progress or delay scrapping ships</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Expectation of Shipowners</strong></p>
<p>A key factor influencing shipowners’ decision to scrap or order new ships is the expectations of <strong>future levels of freight demand</strong> and <strong>freight rates. Future</strong> expectation is crucial in determining how the shipping market reacts to short-term changes in demand and freight rate levels. If shipowners are <strong>optimistic</strong> about the future freight rates and demand, falling rates in the short term may <strong>not</strong> lead to a longer-term reduction in shipping capacity. If shipowners are <strong>pessimistic</strong> about the future freight rates and demand, any short-term market downturns may lead to a shortage of capacity if demand grows at an unexpected place. Shipowners’ future expectations can be very <strong>volatile</strong>. Volatility helps to explain the sudden increases and sudden falls of freight rates, particularly when political events, wars, or other events can have strategic impacts on dry cargo markets.</p>
<p>Here above fright rate model implies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A strong positive correlation</strong> between demand growth and new orders when the present stock of ships is highly utilized with low levels of lay-up</li>
<li>Freight rates should be sensitive to <strong>short-run market conditions</strong>. Freight rates reflect both present market and future expectations</li>
<li><strong>Exceptional events</strong> such as wars, political event, embargoes, closure of canals generate significant increases in freight rates when the present stock of ships is highly utilized</li>
<li>A strong positive correlation between freight rates and new orders, with periods of high rates associated with higher than average orders, lower than average lay-ups, and scrapping</li>
</ul>
<p>In the period between 1947-1984, based on a notional value of 100 for 1965, <strong>without</strong> inflation effects, later shipping booms would look <strong>larger</strong> and the earlier shipping booms look <strong>smaller</strong>. There are substantial periods of demand growth in which freight rates do <strong>not</strong> fluctuate all that dramatically. In these flat periods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plenty of ship capacity available to meet any increase in demand</li>
<li>Expansion of demand is matched by the correct expansion of capacity, brought about by accurate expectations generating the correct level of ordering</li>
</ul>
<p>Shipping <strong>spikes</strong> are generated by <strong>external events</strong> that are <strong>not</strong> completely <strong>anticipated</strong> by the shipping market. Shipping <strong>spikes</strong> are generated by <strong>external events</strong> such as wars or war-related events. For example, the 1973 shipping crises. Growth in demand for shipping services was very high in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Many shipowners ordered new large ships. However, in September 1973, the shipping boom came to a halt with the six-day Arab-Israeli war. Suez Canal closed and the Arab oil embargo on countries seen as pro-Israel triggered a 400% rise in the price of crude oil delivered a huge shock to the Western economies that had been previously growing quite rapidly. Western economies’ growth faltered and income fell in 1974. Lower economic growth means lower growth in the demand for shipping.</p>
<p>Shipping rate peaks of <strong>1970</strong> and <strong>1973</strong> correspond to two of the years of highest annual growth of <strong>tonne-mile</strong> demand:</p>
<ul>
<li>1970 Annual tonne-mile demand growth <strong>3%</strong></li>
<li>1973 Annual tonne-mile demand growth <strong>2%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Shipping demand actually fell by <strong>2.3%</strong> in 1975. In 1984, demand grew at <strong>10.2%</strong>, but there is <strong>no</strong> peak in the freight rates in 1984. The difference in the two situations is due to laid-up tonnage. In 1970 and 1973, very little tonnage was laid-up. However, in 1984, over 20% of the fleet was laid up. In 1984, an increase in demand was easily met from existing ship capacity and <strong>no peak</strong> in freight rates.</p>
<p>In 1970 and 1973 peaks, demand is at or near full ship capacity, so further increases triggered to generate large freight rate increases as supply response was very small. But, in 1984, there was plenty of spare capacity and significant increases in demand were met with <strong>no</strong> corresponding rise in freight rates. The shipping volatility index, based on 1985 = 100, shows that the average freight rate has risen sharply since 2003, and so the volatility of the freight rate. The dramatic change in the shipping market has been since 2003. Since 2003, intra-year shipping volatility jumps from around 3% to figures which range between <strong>14%</strong> and <strong>33%</strong>.</p>
<p>The dramatic increase in freight rates and volatility between 2003-2008:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tonne-mile</strong> <strong>demand</strong> rose at a remarkable rate between 2003-2008 (over 6% per year)</li>
<li>Fleet capacity did not grow as fast, ships have to work harder and freight rates spiked</li>
<li>An increase in freight rates did <strong>not</strong> solve the problem</li>
<li>Gross profit margins were very large</li>
</ul>
<p>Between 2003-2008, such huge earnings caused the <strong>scrapping</strong> of dry cargo ships to more or less <strong>disappear</strong> and generated a <strong>record number of newbuilding orders</strong>. Future freight rates are therefore being affected by the delivery of new tonnage and prospective future demand growth. The dramatic increase in freight rates also affected the price of <strong>secondhand tonnage</strong> and secondhand prices became very high. Between 2003-2008, in certain cases, a secondhand ship became more expensive than its newbuild equivalent due to delivery time. This is called <strong>ready ship premium</strong>.</p>
<p>Reasons for a dramatic increase in freight rates and volatility between 2003-2008:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2001, <strong>China</strong> entered the WTO (World Trade Organization). China became a major player in international trade. China’s economy has grown at <strong>10%</strong> per year compound for many years. China’s demand for <strong>steel</strong> China became the <strong>world’s largest steel producer</strong> which increased the demand for steel shipping</li>
<li>Production of <strong>steel</strong> requires <strong>iron ore</strong> and <strong>coking coal</strong>. China’s demand for both iron ore and coal rose dramatically</li>
<li>Rapid <strong>growth in world trade</strong> has stimulated increased manufacturing. Manufacturing triggered the demand for raw materials and also trade has been liberalized.</li>
<li>Many other economies have grown rapidly such as India</li>
<li><strong>Shortages</strong> of suitable ships caused to move cargoes into two bottoms. Shortage of ship supply as cargo demand shifted. Transportation costs rose.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dynamic Shipping Model</strong></p>
<p>Here above freight rate model concentrated upon demand and supply conditions. The only additional factor is the role of <strong>shipowners’ future expectations</strong>. Shipowners’ future expectations help to determine shipowners’ ordering, scrapping, and operational decisions. In order to determine the shipowners’ future expectations, we need to look at past events. Historical data and recent trends can be projected forward to estimate the shipowners’ future expectations as to future demand conditions.</p>
<p>Newbuilding ordering in the early 1970s can be seen as a response to the widely-held view that the market was going to continue to grow as rapidly in the second half of the 1970s as it did till 1973.</p>
<p>If a shipowner anticipates a prosperous period, the shipowner needs to order as early as possible, because newbuilding ship construction takes around two years if there is an available slot at the shipyards. There are two possible outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shipowner’s future expectations are fulfilled, shipping demand grows as every shipping market player is expected it to and the capacity is met</li>
<li>Shipowner’s future expectations turn out to be incorrect and the unexpected happens. New ships have been ordered and a large number of them have been delivered. The shipping market is oversupplied.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1973, shipping market conditions were a nightmare for shipowners but profitable for charterers. The shipping market was in turmoil with large numbers of ships and little growth in shipping demand. In 2010, a similar situation occurred, following the 2008 financial crisis. Annual deliveries of new bulk carriers continued to <strong>increase until 2011</strong> when 97.7 million DWT was delivered. The scrapping of dry bulk ships also increased, peaking in <strong>2012</strong> at 32.5 million DWT. The key difference between the 1970s and 2010s shipping crises is that <strong>laid-up</strong> and <strong>idle tonnage</strong> remained at <strong>low levels</strong> in 2010s, with shipowners opting to <strong>slow steam</strong> in order to absorb some of the surplus tonnages. Dry freight markets continue to be depressed since 2012, notwithstanding seasonal and other temporary improvements. In both cases, the 1970s and 2010s shipping crises, a contributory factor to the <strong>over-ordering</strong> of newbuilding ships are that <strong>shipping finance</strong> was widely <strong>available</strong> during a period of growth and high freight rates. Estimating demand and supply conditions in the <strong>next decade</strong> would therefore make <strong>very little sense</strong> if an analyst just examined demand and supply in the <strong>current year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The current shipping supply available is the consequence of past decisions by shipowners</strong>.</p>
<p>Shipping market players never really learn from previous mistakes and keep ordering new ships. Overbuilding will impact on earnings in all shipping markets. The crucial factor is to order early and not to be the last shipowner to order. In the shipping business, once freight rates increase and the shipping market starts to move, other shipowners join in and herd behavior will eventually result in tonnage oversupply. Therefore, the shipping market generates its own <strong>dynamic behavior model</strong> over time, as the shipping market continually <strong>readjusts</strong> to new demand conditions. Poor market conditions influence newbuilding decisions and orders became relatively scarce. On the other hand, if demand conditions alter for the better this lack of new investment may itself generate <strong>another shipping cycle</strong>.</p>
<p>Dry cargo markets appear to move through <strong>cycles</strong> of boom, recession, slump, recovery, and back to boom again. Shipping cycles are partly generated by the <strong>cyclical growth in shipping demand</strong>. However, shipping cycles are also a result of the fact that <strong>supply adjustment is a slow</strong> process. Shipping analysts have suggested that there are cycles of different periods observable in the shipping market. These different shipping cycles are <strong>overlaying</strong> each other. Seasonal pattern of demand as being the shortest cycle. On top of that, world demand growth appears to cycle over 5-7 years. Ship supply cycles are longer, on average 13 years. On top of that, very long cyclical patterns of around 50 years. Viewing the shipping market as a dynamic model, as a process in which demand conditions and supply responses change over time, gives a much richer picture of the way the shipping market operates. In sum, ship supply responds to a change in demand, often spread out over several periods.</p>
<p>Freight rates are the outcome of a <strong>bargaining process</strong>, based on their <strong>expectations of future</strong> demand and supply, rather than simply the balance of supply and demand at a particular place and time. Shipowners and charterers form expectations of future freight rates and <strong>bargain</strong> over the <strong>deviation</strong> of future rates from the latest fixture. The final outcome is influenced by the relative bargaining power of each shipowner and charterer. If the <strong>charterer</strong> has more power freight rate deviation will be <strong>lower</strong> than latest fixture. If the <strong>shipowner</strong> has more power freight rate deviation will be <strong>higher</strong> than the latest fixture. Many factors can affect the relative bargaining power of shipowners and charterers, but <strong>economic conditions</strong> are the single most important factor in most situations. In <strong>improving</strong> economic conditions, <strong>shipowners</strong> have bargaining power. In <strong>worsening</strong> economic conditions, <strong>charterers</strong> have the bargaining power. In bargaining power, <strong>information</strong> is also an important factor especially when information is comprehensive, accurate, timely, and cheap. Therefore, the role of the <strong>shipbroker</strong> is crucial in central to the discussion on bargaining between shipowners and charterers. Despite all the improvements in communications and technology, shipbrokers continue to have a role in <strong>assimilating information</strong> for shipowners and charterers.</p>

<h3 id="dry-bulk-chartering"><strong>Dry Bulk Chartering</strong></h3>
<h4 id="what-is-ship-chartering"><strong>What is Ship Chartering?</strong></h4>
<p>Chartering refers to the act of contracting a vessel or a portion of a vessel for the transportation of goods by sea. This may occur on any type of vessel and for any type of cargo, including bulk, general, or specialized cargo, among others.</p>
<p>Chartering plays a crucial role in the shipping industry and is central to its economic framework. The Ship Chartering Market is comprised of Shipowners seeking to charter out tonnage and Charterers looking to charter in tonnage for transportation services.</p>
<p>The demand for shipping arises from the need to transport cargo on behalf of Shippers and Traders. This demand is satisfied by the Chartering Market, which manages the transportation requirements. Shipowners seeking to fill ship capacity with cargo will do so through the Chartering Market. Additionally, the Ship Chartering Market caters to the needs of Ship Operators, who may not possess cargo per se but operate ships and offer shipping services.</p>
<p>The complex and efficient Ship Chartering Process can fulfill the demand for ship transport. It begins with the parties in need of tonnage and is executed by the Shipowner who provides that capacity.</p>
<p>The Ship Chartering Market connects the supply of ships in the global merchant fleet with the demand for seaborne trade. It caters to the transportation needs of all types of seaborne cargo and ships.</p>
<p>The Dry Cargo Market and the Tanker Market experience the most intense ship chartering activity. Other types of ships can also be chartered by Ship Operators and Charterers requiring specialized transportation capacity, but chartering activity in these markets tends to be less intense due to the prevalence of long-term chartering contracts.</p>
<p>The ship chartering process is facilitated by the Shipbroker, who acts on behalf of the Principal (Shipowner or Charterer). The Shipbroker is a skilled individual with experience in the ship chartering process, as well as a network of contacts and associates instrumental in efficiently executing it.</p>
<p>The Shipbroker communicates relevant information and receives information on ship positions and cargoes, analyzing all data. Additionally, the Shipbroker assists in Chartering Negotiations, which entail the placement of cargo orders and ship positions by Charterers and Shipowners, respectively, and the exchange of offers and counteroffers until an agreement is reached. Following the chartering negotiations and agreement, the Shipbroker may be responsible for drafting the Charterparty (a maritime contract between a Shipowner and a Charterer) agreed upon by the parties.</p>
<p>The ship will sail on the agreed routes or be placed at the disposal of the Charterer for a Voyage Charter or Time Charter. In a Voyage Charter, the Charterer must pay Freight, while in a Time Charter, the Charterer is obligated to pay Hire. Shipbrokers may also engage in post-fixture work or work related to the performance of the Charterparty.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-the-main-types-of-ship-chartering"><strong>What are the main types of Ship Chartering?</strong></h4>
<p>Merchant vessels are in existence for the purpose of transporting cargoes. With the exception of certain oil companies, ship owners have little proprietary interest in the goods being transported by their ships. Consequently, they rely on others to hire or charter their ships to generate income. The two principal forms of ship chartering are Voyage Charter and Time Charter.</p>
<p>Under Voyage Charter, the ship is chartered to transport cargo from a designated port or ports and transport it to another specified port of discharge, or a range of discharge ports, in exchange for the payment of freight.</p>
<p>On the other hand, under Time Charter, the charterer hires the ship for a predetermined period of time, and pays hire for each day, hour, and minute that the ship is at their disposal. The most widely used dry cargo time charter is the New York Produce Exchange Form (1946).</p>
<h4 id="what-is-voyage-charter"><strong>What is Voyage Charter?</strong></h4>
<p>A Voyage Charter or Spot Charter involves engaging a ship for a single voyage, where the vessel is tasked to transport cargo from a specific load port or ports to a discharge port or ports within a mutually agreed area.</p>
<p>The Shipowner bears the responsibility for all operational expenses of the ship, including additional expenses incurred during the voyage, such as port charges and bunkers, with the exception of cargo-handling expenses, which are generally covered by the charterer.</p>
<p>In dry bulk chartering, some charterparties may specify overtime costs for loading or unloading the cargo, including who is responsible for paying the additional charges. Typically, the crew members are under the Shipowner’s responsibility, while the charterer is responsible for compensating the stevedores.</p>
<p>However, in tanker chartering, the issue of cost does not arise, as the cargo is pumped into the ship by the shore and, therefore, the shipper effectively covers the expenses. The ship’s pumps are then utilized to discharge the cargo, which incurs a cost for the Shipowner.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-voyage-charterparty">**What is Voyage Charterparty? **</h4>
<p>The Voyage Charterparty constitutes a contract between the Shipowner and a Charterer who seeks the services of a vessel. The primary aim of this agreement is to procure the use of a ship and its crew to transport a consignment of goods from one port to another on behalf of the charterer.</p>
<p>In exchange for providing the vessel to the charterer, the owner receives Freight, and in certain cases, demurrage. Freight refers to the compensation earned by the owner for providing the vessel and carrying the charterer’s cargo. The amount of Freight is typically determined by the quantity of cargo loaded and will be negotiated based on the owner’s estimate of the time required for the voyage.</p>
<p>However, the Shipowner cannot accurately predict the time that the vessel will spend in port loading and discharging cargo. Consequently, a fixed period known as Laytime is allowed for these operations, and provision is made for the payment of liquidated damages in case the laytime period is exceeded, which is referred to as Demurrage.</p>
<p>From an English legal perspective, there is no prescribed form that the Voyage Charterparty must adhere to. In fact, this agreement may even be oral and need not be in writing. However, given the potential uncertainty and misunderstanding that oral agreements can give rise to, written contracts are preferred, and various Standard Form Voyage Charterparties have been developed and are commonly utilized.</p>
<p>In the realm of dry bulk chartering, the GENCON Voyage Charterparty is a widely employed contract.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-freight"><strong>What is Freight?</strong></h4>
<p>In the context of Voyage Chartering, Freight refers to the compensation paid by the Charterer to the Shipowner for the conveyance of cargo.</p>
<p>Typically, the Freight can be paid in one of two ways – either on a per-tonne basis or as a Lump Sum. The payment is usually made upon the delivery of the cargo for tanker shipments or upon the signing of Bills of Lading for dry cargo shipments. In some cases, the payment may be split between these two events, with a portion paid after the signing of Bills of Lading and the remaining portion paid upon the actual delivery of the cargo.</p>
<p>In the domain of tanker chartering, Worldscale is utilized to calculate the Freight. This method implies that the Freight amount is not finalized until the discharge port is nominated. In such instances, the quantity of cargo to be loaded is agreed upon beforehand, and the Charterer generally provides a full cargo. However, as the Shipowner is uncertain about the exact capacity of the ship at this stage, it is usually described as a given tonnage with a fixed percentage MOLOO (More or Less in Owners’ Option) or MOLCHOP/MOLCHOPT (More or Less in Charterers’ Option). While using the abbreviation MOLCO is not advisable, as the handwritten version can be too similar to its opposite, MOLOO. For instance, if a shipment is described as 100,000 tonnes 10% MOLOO, it means that the Shipowner can load up to 110,000 tonnes or a minimum of 90,000 tonnes. On arriving at the loading port, the Ship Master calculates the bunkers, constants, and draft restrictions to determine the precise quantity of cargo the ship can load.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-charterparty"><strong>What is Charterparty?</strong></h4>
<p>In the realm of dry cargo markets, the majority of shipping agreements concern the transportation of voluminous, unprocessed materials. The conventional mode of conveyance for such raw bulk materials is known as the charterparty.</p>
<p>The term “charterparty” is derived from the Latin phrase carta partita, meaning “split paper,” referring to a document that is duplicated so that each party retains a copy. In certain legal texts pertaining to shipping, the expression “Contract of Affreightment” (CoA) is used in place of the term “Contract of Carriage” (Charterparty).</p>
<h4 id="what-is-coa-contract-of-affreightment"><strong>What is COA (Contract of Affreightment)?</strong></h4>
<p>The term “Contract of Affreightment” is a more precise means of denoting the conveyance of goods by sea, and within the maritime community, it has taken on a particular connotation as a specific type of agreement. These agreements, known as COAs, are employed when a ship operator or owner commits to transporting a specified quantity of goods during a predetermined time frame.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-the-difference-between-coa-contract-of-affreightment-and-charterparty"><strong>What is the difference between COA (Contract of Affreightment and Charterparty?</strong></h4>
<p>A Charterparty is a contractual agreement entered into by a Shipowner and a Charterer. In this agreement, the Shipowner commits to either transporting cargo for the Charterer on their vessel or granting the Charterer access to the entire or part of the vessel’s hold for the purpose of cargo carriage on a designated voyage or multiple voyages, or for a specific time period (as in the case of a Time Charter).</p>
<p>On the other hand, a Contract of Affreightment (COA) is another type of agreement between a Shipowner and a Charterer. A COA is typically used when the Shipowner or Ship Operator agrees to transport a particular quantity of cargo over a predetermined period of time. Unlike a Charterparty, the COA does not stipulate a specific vessel.</p>
<p>In a Contract of Affreightment, the responsibility of delivering ships as per the project’s requirements lies with the Shipowner or Ship Operator. This grants them considerable freedom to manage their fleet to their advantage. Additionally, the Shipowner or Ship Operator may hire additional vessels if their fleet is already occupied with more profitable work.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-the-difference-between-coa-contract-of-affreightment-and-charterparty-1"><strong>What is the difference between COA (Contract of Affreightment and Charterparty?</strong></h4>
<p>A Contract of Affreightment (COA) and a Charterparty are both agreements related to the transportation of goods via a vessel, but they differ in terms of scope, nature, and duration. Here are the key differences between the two:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scope:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Contract of Affreightment (COA): A COA is an agreement between a shipper (cargo owner) and a carrier (ship owner) for the transportation of a specific quantity of cargo over a period of time. The contract covers multiple voyages or shipments, and the carrier is responsible for providing the required vessel capacity to transport the agreed-upon cargo.</li>
<li>Charterparty: A Charterparty is a contract between a shipowner and a charterer (the party hiring the vessel) for the use of a vessel or its cargo space. It can be for a single voyage (Voyage Charter) or for a specific period (Time Charter). The charterer typically has more control over the vessel, deciding the ports, routes, and cargo.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Duration:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Contract of Affreightment (COA): A COA generally covers a longer period, ranging from several months to a few years, depending on the agreed-upon terms. It is more focused on the long-term transportation of goods.</li>
<li>Charterparty: The duration of a Charterparty depends on the type of charter. A Voyage Charter lasts for a single voyage, whereas a Time Charter can last for a specific period, typically ranging from a few months to several years.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Payment:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Contract of Affreightment (COA): The payment in a COA is usually based on the volume of cargo transported, referred to as the freight rate. This rate can be fixed or flexible, depending on the terms of the agreement.</li>
<li>Charterparty: In a Voyage Charter, the payment is based on the cargo quantity, while in a Time Charter, the payment is based on the daily hire rate for the vessel, which is agreed upon between the shipowner and the charterer.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Flexibility and control:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Contract of Affreightment (COA): In a COA, the carrier has more control over the vessel, deciding the routes and scheduling to fulfill their obligation to transport the cargo. The shipper has limited control over the vessel.</li>
<li>Charterparty: The charterer has more control over the vessel, deciding the ports, routes, and cargo. In a Time Charter, the charterer may even select the crew and manage the vessel’s daily operations, with some limitations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contract of Affreightment (COA) is an agreement for the transportation of a specific quantity of cargo over a period of time, while a Charterparty is a contract for the use of a vessel or its cargo space, either for a single voyage or a specific period. The main differences lie in the scope, duration, payment, and level of control each party has over the vessel.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-ship-chartering-contract"><strong>What is Ship Chartering Contract?</strong></h4>
<p>In the realm of ship chartering, the Ship Chartering Contract stands out as a prime example of a transaction solely driven by the forces of the shipping market. This type of contract is typically negotiated within a free market environment and is subject exclusively to the laws of supply and demand.</p>
<p>The relative bargaining power of Shipowners and Charterers is heavily influenced by the prevailing conditions of the shipping market. As a result, the Charterparty Terms are negotiated freely without any interference from statutory regulations.</p>
<p>In practice, Shipowners and Charterers commonly utilize a customary Standard Charterparty Form that has been developed specifically for their business. This Standard Charterparty Form is often customized with additional clauses known as Rider Clauses. Depending on the current state of the shipping market, intense negotiations may ensue between Shipowners and Charterers over these Charterparty Amendments, as well as the Freight, Hire, Demurrage, and Despatch Money.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-chartering-fixture"><strong>What is Chartering Fixture?</strong></h4>
<p>When a Charterer requires the services of a ship, they engage the services of Shipbrokers and provide comprehensive information such as cargo details, loading and discharging ports, freight estimates, and the terms of the charterparty. This process is commonly referred to as an Invitation to Treat.</p>
<p>The Shipowner, through their Shipbroker, responds with an Offer that includes crucial details such as the ship’s name, flag, year of construction, class, equipment for cargo handling, among other pertinent details. The Offer also outlines the last three cargoes, cargo intake levels, loading and discharging rates, freight rates, laydays/canceling days, estimated time of arrival, ship position, demurrage, charterparty, and other specific terms such as SHEX (Sundays and Holidays Excluded) or SHINC (Sundays and Holidays Included), eco speeds, commission, and the time limit for the offer.</p>
<p>The Shipowner’s offer is conveyed to the Charterer through the Shipbroker, and if it’s communicated verbally, it will be followed by a telex or email. The use of telex is still prevalent in countries that recognize it since it features an answerback function that provides evidence of when the offer was received by the recipient, which is crucial in establishing whether the offer was timely or not.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the offer can be sent via email, followed by a phone call to confirm its receipt. The Charterer can choose to Reject, Accept, Counter, Accept Except (A/E), or Accept on Subjects.</p>
<p>The Ship chartering negotiations continue with both parties making Counter-Offers until they agree on the details and terms of the charter, except for the subjects. Under English Law, there is no valid Charterparty (Shipping Contract) until all the subjects are lifted.</p>
<p>Therefore, after all the subjects are lifted, the negotiated terms are documented in the Charterparty. While waiting for the subjects to be lifted and before the Charterparty is drafted, the Shipbroker will send a Recapitulation message to both parties, summarizing all the points agreed upon during the chartering negotiations.</p>
<p>At this point, the Shipowner and Charterer verify their messages and corrections to confirm that the Charterparty reflects what was agreed upon during the chartering negotiations.</p>
<p><strong>Chartering Fixture is the term used to indicate that the Charterparty (Shipping Contract) has been established, and the negotiations to charter the ship have been completed.</strong></p>
<p>In some instances, to save time, a Chartering Fixture may be made based on the previous one. In other words, the terms and conditions agreed upon in the previous Chartering Fixture will be repeated, with certain exceptions. Therefore, both parties must be clear on what this means.</p>
<p>If a Shipbroker is authorized to sign a Charterparty (Shipping Contract) on behalf of their Principal (Shipowner or Charterer), they should indicate the source of authority, such as telephone, telex, facsimile, or email authority of the Principal’s name As Agents Only. The fundamental rule is that with a signature qualified in this way, a Shipbroker will not be held personally liable for the performance of the Charterparty (Shipping Contract). If the name of the Principal (Shipowner or Charterer) is not disclosed, then even the qualification of As Agents Only would not exonerate the Shipbroker from liability for the performance of the Charterparty (Shipping Contract).</p>
<h4 id="what-is-stem-in-ship-chartering"><strong>What is STEM</strong> <strong>in Ship Chartering?</strong></h4>
<p>STEM stands for <strong>Subject To Enough Merchandise</strong>, indicating the condition that must be met before proceeding with the shipment. The purpose of STEM is to allow Charterers sufficient time to present the vessel to the Shippers and verify that they can accommodate the agreed-upon amount of cargo on the agreed-upon laydays. STEM is intended solely for determining cargo availability.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-stem-subject-to-enough-merchandise-in-ship-chartering"><strong>What is STEM (Subject To Enough Merchandise) in Ship Chartering?</strong></h4>
<p>In ship chartering, the term STEM (Subject To Enough Merchandise) is used when a vessel’s departure or arrival for loading or discharging cargo is contingent upon the availability of sufficient cargo. This term is often included in charter party agreements, which are contracts outlining the terms and conditions for the use of a vessel.</p>
<p>When a charter agreement includes the term “STEM,” it signifies that the vessel’s readiness to load or discharge cargo is subject to the charterer having enough merchandise available at the port or terminal. If the charterer does not have the required amount of cargo, the vessel may not be obligated to commence loading or discharging operations, and the laytime (the time allowed for loading or discharging cargo) may not start.</p>
<p>The inclusion of STEM in a charter party agreement helps to protect the interests of both the ship owner and the charterer. For the ship owner, it ensures that the vessel is not left waiting at a port without cargo, which can be expensive due to port charges and idle time. For the charterer, it provides flexibility in managing the logistics of their cargo and the timing of its arrival at the port or terminal.</p>
<p>It is essential for both parties to clearly define the conditions and requirements related to STEM in their charter party agreement to avoid any potential disputes or misunderstandings.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-stem-in-order-in-ship-chartering"><strong>What is STEM IN ORDER in Ship Chartering?</strong></h4>
<p>In ship chartering, the term “STEM IN ORDER” (Subject To Enough Merchandise) is used to indicate that the departure, arrival, or loading of a vessel is conditional upon the availability of sufficient cargo. This term is often included in charter party agreements, which outline the terms and conditions for the use of a vessel.</p>
<p>When a charter party agreement includes “STEM IN ORDER,” it means that the vessel’s readiness to load or discharge cargo is dependent on the charterer having enough merchandise available at the port or terminal. If the required amount of cargo is not available, the vessel may not be obligated to commence loading or discharging operations, and the laytime (the time allowed for loading or discharging cargo) may not start.</p>
<p>The inclusion of “STEM IN ORDER” in a charter party agreement helps protect the interests of both the ship owner and the charterer. For the ship owner, it ensures that the vessel is not left waiting at a port without cargo, which can be costly due to port charges and idle time. For the charterer, it provides flexibility in managing the logistics of their cargo and the timing of its arrival at the port or terminal.</p>
<p>Both parties must clearly define the conditions and requirements related to “STEM IN ORDER” in their charter party agreement to prevent any potential disputes or misunderstandings.</p>
<h4 id="ship-chartering-contracts"><strong>Ship Chartering Contracts</strong></h4>
<p>It is feasible to establish a legally binding Ship Chartering Contract (Charter Party Form) through verbal communication. It is within the realm of possibility to charter a ship via an oral telephone conversation. There exists precedent demonstrating that a ship can be chartered orally, although this practice is not typically employed in the commercial shipping industry. The validity of an oral charter and the provisions included in the charter party will depend on the application of local contract law with regard to the formation of a contract.</p>
<p>The form of Ship Chartering and the terms of the Charter Party may vary to some extent, contingent upon the nature of the cargo and the type of vessel involved. Each specialized trade may pose unique legal challenges and may follow distinct industry practices.</p>
<p>Charter Party Forms commonly utilized in the industry can vary by trade, some examples of which are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>GENCON for Dry Bulk Ships</li>
<li>BIMCHEMTIME for Chemical Tankers</li>
<li>BOXTIME 2004 for Container Ships</li>
<li>NYPE (New York Produce Exchange) for Dry Bulk Ships</li>
<li>lntertanko for Tankers</li>

<h4 id="what-is-bareboat-charter"><strong>What is Bareboat Charter?</strong></h4>
<p>The concept of Bareboat Charter is based on the idea that the shipowner has effectively relinquished complete control and possession of the ship to the charterer. This type of charter involves the transfer of control and possession of the ship. When examining a Bareboat charter, courts will likely consider the charter itself, as well as any relevant facts and circumstances, to determine whether the shipowner retains any rights or responsibilities with respect to the ship, such as the right or responsibility to supply the crew or arrange for ship insurance.</p>
<p>In contrast, a space charter, lot charter, or part cargo charter involves only a portion of the ship’s cargo capacity being chartered, rather than the entire ship. These types of charters are typically between ocean common carriers who may charter space from each other to meet customer commitments.</p>
<p>When a Bareboat Charter is in effect, the charterer acts as if they are the shipowner, assuming both responsibility for the ship’s operation and liability limitation rights that the owner may have. For example, under the United States Shipowner’s Limitation of Liability Act, the shipowner is generally permitted to limit its liability to third parties arising from the operation of the ship to the value of the ship and pending freight at the end of the voyage in which the incident occurred either when the ship reaches port, or if the ship is lost, at the time of the loss. This same right is expressly granted to a charterer that mans, supplies, and navigates a ship at their own expense or by their own procurement.</p>
<p>The existence of a Bareboat Charter is also an essential element under United States law with respect to whether a non-citizen financial institution or leasing company may own a U.S. flagship engaged in the United States coastwise trade operated by a qualified United States citizen pursuant to a Bareboat Charter.</p>
<p>If a ship is chartered out as bareboat, the shipowner generally will not be liable to third parties harmed through the operation of the ship. The Bareboat charterer assumes responsibility for any third-party claims. However, maritime law treats a ship itself as a person (in rem), so a third-party plaintiff may seek recovery against both the bareboat charterer and the ship. As a result, unless the shipowner has an effective way to obtain indemnification from the bareboat charterer for claims against the ship, the shipowner may still be exposed to some risk of liability to third parties. Such indemnification provisions are typically found in bareboat charter forms and are supported by associated liability insurance requirements.</p>
<p>One exception to the general rule is where the shipowner takes steps to operate the ship itself, either directly or through an agent, in situations such as when the bareboat charterer has defaulted. In such a case, the shipowner may become the de facto ship operator and may be liable for any claims arising during the period in which they are operating the ship in person.</p>
<p>The bareboat charterer is typically tasked with maintaining the ship’s condition during the charter period. However, it is important to note that, unless otherwise specified in the charter agreement, the bareboat charterer is not responsible for reasonable wear and tear on the vessel. To ensure that a fair assessment is made at the end of the charter period, most bareboat charters involve separate or joint surveyors who thoroughly inspect the ship and produce a detailed condition report. This report serves as a benchmark against which reasonable wear and tear can be measured.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that damage or loss to the ship can occur regardless of the bareboat charterer’s fault. Therefore, it is common practice for the charter agreement to require the bareboat charterer to maintain hull and machinery insurance, with loss payable clauses directing payments to the shipowner.</p>
<p>While a bareboat charter agreement may allocate responsibility for deductibles, it is more often the case that the bareboat charterer is responsible for these costs. Additionally, it is important to bear in mind that the shipowner is liable for any harm caused to third parties as a result of the ship’s operation, particularly in the case of time or voyage charters.</p>

<h4 id="voyage-charter-vs-time-charter"><strong>Voyage Charter Vs Time Charter</strong></h4>
<p>When a ship is chartered on a time or voyage basis, it remains under the operational and legal control of the shipowner, who is responsible for the crew, maintenance, and operation of the vessel. Consequently, any harm caused by the ship may be attributed to the shipowner, as well as to the ship itself. It is customary for shipowners to ensure that they have adequate insurance coverage against potential risks that may be incurred during operations under time and voyage charters. To ensure that the insurance package covers charter risks, express provisions are often included in time and voyage charters, specifying the permitted trades, cargoes, and ports.</p>
<p>In addition, voyage charters and time charters may include provisions in which the charterer agrees to warrant the safety of ports and indemnify the shipowner against the risks of any breaches of the permitted trade clauses. When a ship is chartered out as a bareboat charter, the shipowner must be concerned about liability. In addition to the contractual rights the shipowner has under the bareboat charter, the ship itself remains potentially liable, as if it were a person, in the event of an accident or other legally cognizable harm. This is known as in Rem Liability, which is distinguished from the separate liability that the shipowner or bareboat charterer may have in Personam Liability, potentially for the same actions and liabilities.</p>
<p>Shipowners typically warrant the seaworthiness of their vessels. Every charter agreement is deemed to include a generally recognized implied warranty of seaworthiness, even if the seaworthiness clause is not expressly stated in the charter party. Seaworthiness means that the ship is reasonably capable of safely transporting the cargo it has undertaken to transport within the specified trading areas, under the conditions that can reasonably be expected. The shipowner can expressly disclaim the warranty of seaworthiness in a charter, and such disclaimers are frequently found in ship lease finance transactions where the shipowner is a bank, financial institution, or leasing company. However, even with an express disclaimer, shipowners should be aware of potential liability for any latent defects that may arise prior to the commencement of a charter that would render the ship unseaworthy. Generally, the voyage charterer or time charterer is not liable for the seaworthiness of the vessel or the negligence of the ship’s crew.</p>
<p>In cases of time or voyage charter, the shipowner or bareboat charterer typically retains control of the vessel, with the charterer merely providing commercial direction. The ship will operate within the parameters of the charter, loading and discharging cargo as required.</p>
<p>Traditionally, voyage or time charterers do not have authority over crew members and thus cannot be held accountable for their actions. However, if the charterer assumes responsibility for cargo-related operations such as loading, stowage, or discharging, then the shipowner may be held liable if any damage or loss occurs.</p>
<p>For long-term bareboat charters, particularly those with finance arrangements, the bareboat charterer must ensure compliance with ongoing regulatory changes at their own expense. Short-term charters usually see the shipowner retain responsibility for complying with all relevant flag-state and international regulations. For example, changes to international air pollution regulations may necessitate the use of low sulfur fuels in certain coastal waters, or the replacement of older boiler systems. The shipowner typically bears these costs for vessels under time or voyage charter, whereas those under bareboat charter may be borne by either party depending on the specific provisions of the agreement. This may require a review of the ship owner’s obligation to provide a compliant vessel versus the charterer’s obligation to maintain compliance.</p>
<p>Bunker costs, including fuel for the main engine and auxiliary engines, can be a significant expense and are an important consideration in charter agreements. Under a bareboat charter, the shipowner assumes no responsibility for bunker costs as all operating responsibilities are assigned to the bareboat charterer. In a time charter, the time charterer is generally responsible for bunker costs incurred. In voyage charters, responsibility for bunker costs may be allocated to either party, depending on their preferences. Charterers must also allocate responsibility for bunkers that do not meet quality standards. Substandard bunkers may damage engines, cause power loss, and result in salvage costs, delays, or even the loss of the vessel. Failure to comply with regulations, such as sulfur content requirements, can result in civil penalties or detention.</p>
<p>Responsibility for the consequences of using improper bunkers typically follows responsibility for the bunker costs, although this is not always the case. Charterers may not have the technical expertise or personnel to properly screen and test bunker providers, and may rely on the ship’s engineers to do so, even if the time or voyage charterer is responsible for the bunker costs.</p>
<h4 id="bill-of-lading-bl-in-ship-chartering"><strong>Bill of Lading (B/L) in Ship Chartering</strong></h4>
<p>The Bill of Lading serves a multitude of purposes; however, it primarily functions as the contract between the shipper of goods and the carrier who assumes responsibility for transporting said goods. In the case of a bareboat chartered ship, the carrier may not be the shipowner, but rather the bareboat charterer, time charterer, or voyage charterer. By extending the limitations of liability and other protective provisions to the shipowner, the Bill of Lading mitigates the risk of indemnification claims. Within the shipping industry, there are fundamental charter terms that are unique to the field. These terms carry specific meanings that have become entrenched and often possess intriguing histories, originating from significant maritime decisions or ship casualties. For instance, charter lease payments, also known as “charter hire,” may be payable regardless of whether the ship completes the charter or not. Such provisions, where the charterer has no routine right of set-off or reduction in the amount payable to the shipowner, are often referred to as being payable on a “hell or high water” basis, as in charter hire shall be payable, come “hell or high water.” These charter payment provisions are typically found in bareboat charters and not in time charters or voyage charters. Time charter hire or voyage charter hire is typically subject to a right to set-off if the ship fails to perform under the charter.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-fios-in-ship-chartering"><strong>What is FIOS in Ship Chartering?</strong></h4>
<p>The abbreviation FIO stands for Free In, Out, and FIOS stands for Free In, Out, and Stowage. The terms FIO and FIOS relate to the allocation of responsibility between the shipowner or bareboat charterer and the time charterer or voyage charterer regarding the loading and discharging of the ship. Under FIOS terms, the charterer takes responsibility for ensuring that the ship will be loaded, the cargo stowed, and the ship discharged, free to the shipowner.</p>
<p>FIOS in ship chartering stands for <strong>“Free In and Out and Stowed.”</strong> It is a term used in the shipping and chartering industry to describe the conditions under which cargo is loaded and discharged from a vessel. FIOS is typically agreed upon by both the shipowner and the charterer during negotiations and is included in the charter party agreement.</p>
<p>Under FIOS terms, the charterer is responsible for the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Free In:</strong> The charterer bears the cost and responsibility for loading the cargo onto the vessel at the port of loading. This includes any stevedoring, labor, and equipment costs associated with getting the cargo on board.</li>
<li><strong>Free Out:</strong> The charterer is also responsible for the cost and responsibility of unloading the cargo from the vessel at the port of discharge. Similar to the loading process, this includes any costs related to stevedoring, labor, and equipment required for unloading.</li>
<li><strong>Stowed:</strong> The charterer is responsible for the proper stowage of the cargo within the vessel. This means ensuring that the cargo is safely and securely placed in the ship’s holds to prevent any damage during transit.</li>
</ol>
<p>By agreeing to FIOS terms, the charterer takes on more responsibility for cargo handling, which may allow for more control over the loading and unloading process. However, it also means the charterer is responsible for any additional costs and potential risks associated with cargo handling.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-fio-in-ship-chartering"><strong>What is FIO in Ship Chartering?</strong></h4>
<p>FIO in ship chartering stands for <strong>“Free In and Out.”</strong> It is a term used in the shipping and chartering industry to describe the conditions under which cargo is loaded and discharged from a vessel. FIO is typically agreed upon by both the shipowner and the charterer during negotiations and is included in the charter party agreement.</p>
<p>Under FIO terms, the charterer is responsible for the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Free In:</strong> The charterer bears the cost and responsibility for loading the cargo onto the vessel at the port of loading. This includes any stevedoring, labor, and equipment costs associated with getting the cargo on board.</li>
<li><strong>Free Out:</strong> The charterer is also responsible for the cost and responsibility of unloading the cargo from the vessel at the port of discharge. Similar to the loading process, this includes any costs related to stevedoring, labor, and equipment required for unloading.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike the FIOS term, which includes “Stowed,” the FIO term does not cover the responsibility for the proper stowage of the cargo within the vessel. Under FIO terms, the shipowner is typically responsible for ensuring that the cargo is safely and securely placed in the ship’s holds to prevent any damage during transit.</p>
<p>By agreeing to FIO terms, the charterer takes on the responsibility for cargo handling during loading and unloading but not for cargo stowage. This arrangement allows the charterer more control over the loading and unloading process while still relying on the shipowner’s expertise for proper stowage.</p>
<h4 id="demurrage-dispatch-and-lay-days-in-ship-chartering"><strong>Demurrage, Dispatch, and Lay Days in Ship Chartering</strong></h4>
<p>Demurrage, Dispatch, and Lay Days are nautical terms commonly employed in the context of a voyage charter. A voyage charter is an agreement between the shipowner and the charterer for the transportation of cargo from one point to another, with the charter price being calculated based on the shipowner’s estimation of the time required for the voyage. However, the loading and unloading time of the cargo by the charterer is subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which is where the concept of Lay Days comes into play. Lay Days refer to the number of days allowed for the loading and discharging of cargo, and are employed to manage the uncertainty surrounding this activity.</p>
<p>The term Demurrage refers to the compensation payable by the voyage charterer to the shipowner in the event that the loading or unloading of cargo exceeds the agreed-upon Lay Days. Conversely, Dispatch refers to the compensation payable by the shipowner to the charterer if the loading or unloading of cargo is completed in less time than the allowed Lay Days. It is noteworthy that traditionally, Dispatch is priced at a rate that is 50% of the Demurrage rate.</p>
<p>These concepts have been developed over time to ensure the efficient utilization of ships and to allocate the risks associated with delays to the party that is best placed to influence the timing of the loading and unloading activities. In a voyage charter, the charterer is responsible for the purchase, utilization, and sale of the cargo, and is, therefore, in the best position to arrange for an efficient loading and unloading of the ship.</p>
<p>Dead Freight is another term that is commonly associated with voyage charters. In many voyage charters, the charter hire is based on the amount of cargo to be transported. If the charterer fails to load the expected amount of cargo, the shipowner is still obligated to undertake the voyage but will receive less revenue than anticipated. To manage this risk, a voyage charter will often specify a minimum amount of cargo to be transported, and if the charterer fails to load this amount, they will be liable to pay an amount known as Dead Freight, which is calculated based on the shortfall.</p>
<p>In tanker chartering, the concept of vetting is primarily associated with oil companies that charter ships to transport their products. Given the high value of the cargo, the potential for significant losses due to ship breakdowns or port state detentions, and the risk of legal and reputational damage resulting from oil spills or other accidents, many charterers insist on the right to conduct their own ship condition inspections before or during chartering. These inspections, known as vetting inspections, are often comprehensive and evaluate the ship’s certificates, physical condition, and crew qualifications and experience.</p>
<h4 id="basic-terms-in-ship-chartering"><strong>Basic Terms in Ship Chartering</strong></h4>
<p>In the context of voyage charters, several key terms and concepts are commonly used to manage uncertainties and risks related to cargo loading and discharging, as well as ship conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lay Days:</strong> The shipowner allows a certain number of days for loading and discharging cargo under a voyage charter. These days are referred to as lay days, and they help manage the unpredictability of loading and discharging times.</li>
<li><strong>Demurrage:</strong> If the charterer takes longer to load or discharge cargo than the agreed-upon lay days, they must pay the shipowner a fee called demurrage. This concept promotes efficient ship utilization and allocates the risk of delays to the party in the best position to manage loading and discharging times – the charterer.</li>
<li><strong>Dispatch:</strong> Conversely, if the charterer completes loading or discharging faster than the allowed lay days, the shipowner pays the charterer a fee called dispatch, typically priced at 50% of the demurrage rate. This encourages the charterer to be efficient and rewards them for saving time.</li>
<li><strong>Dead Freight:</strong> In voyage charters, the charter hire is often based on the amount of cargo carried. If the charterer loads less cargo than the shipowner expected, the charterer must pay the shipowner an amount called dead freight, based on the cargo shortfall. This protects the shipowner against revenue loss due to carrying less cargo than anticipated.</li>
<li><strong>Vetting:</strong> In tanker chartering, vetting is a critical concept, particularly for oil companies chartering ships for their products. Due to the high value of cargo, potential delays, legal liabilities, and reputational risks from incidents like oil spills, charterers often insist on conducting their own ship condition inspections before chartering or continuing charters. These inspections, called vetting inspections, can be extensive, examining ship certificates, documents, physical condition, and crew qualifications and experience.</li>
</ol>
<p>These terms and concepts are crucial in voyage chartering to ensure both parties have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities while minimizing risks and promoting efficiency:</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Notice of Readiness (NOR):</strong> The shipowner or master of the vessel issues a Notice of Readiness to inform the charterer that the vessel has arrived at the loading or discharging port and is ready to commence cargo operations. This notice marks the beginning of laytime, the period during which the charterer has to load or discharge the cargo within the agreed lay days.</li>
<li><strong>Laytime:</strong> Laytime refers to the time allowed by the shipowner for the charterer to load and discharge cargo without incurring additional costs. Laytime is usually stated in the charter party agreement and starts when the Notice of Readiness has been tendered. The calculation of laytime can be complex and may involve various exceptions and conditions such as weather-related interruptions and holidays.</li>
<li><strong>Time Bar:</strong> A time bar is a contractual provision that sets a deadline for a claim to be made by one party against the other. In voyage charters, time bars can apply to claims related to demurrage, dispatch, and other performance-related issues. If a claim is not made within the time bar period, the party’s right to claim may be forfeited.</li>
<li><strong>Charter Party Agreement:</strong> The charter party agreement is a legal contract between the shipowner and the charterer, outlining the terms and conditions of the voyage charter. This agreement contains various provisions, including the agreed freight rate, lay days, demurrage and dispatch rates, vetting requirements, and other specific terms related to the carriage of goods.</li>
<li><strong>Freight:</strong> Freight is the payment made by the charterer to the shipowner for the transportation of goods under a voyage charter. The freight rate is typically agreed upon in the charter party agreement and can be based on factors such as the type and volume of cargo, distance between ports, and prevailing market rates.</li>
</ol>
<p>By understanding and utilizing these terms and concepts, both shipowners and charterers can better manage the risks and uncertainties inherent in the shipping and chartering industry, leading to a more efficient and secure transportation of goods across the globe.</p>

<h4 id="cesser-clause-in-ship-chartering"><strong>Cesser Clause in Ship Chartering</strong></h4>
<p>The “Cesser Clause” is a term commonly used in charter agreements, which stipulates that the charterer’s responsibility to pay charter hire will terminate if, for specified reasons, the vessel becomes unavailable for the purpose of transporting or loading and unloading cargo. These clauses typically arise in situations where the charterer may have already sold the cargo, even prior to the delivery of the ship.</p>
<h4 id="both-to-blame-collision-clauses-in-ship-chartering"><strong>Both to Blame Collision Clauses in Ship Chartering</strong></h4>
<p>The purpose of Both to Blame Collision Clauses is to safeguard the limitation of liability clauses that are commonly present in charters and bills of lading. These clauses aim to prevent a loophole that could arise due to the maritime law’s allocation of collision damages. According to maritime law, a court will apportion damages between the parties at fault based on their comparative fault. However, both parties will be held jointly and severally liable to the victims of their fault. This means that the injured party can sue either of the parties at fault for the full amount of the damage, and the paying party can seek contribution from the other party at fault.</p>
<p>Typically, a ship owner’s liability for cargo damage is restricted to a specific amount, such as the $500 per package limitation under the United States Carriage of Goods at Sea Act (COGSA). Therefore, when a collision occurs due to the fault of both the cargo-carrying ship and another ship, the cargo owner’s right to damages from the cargo-carrying ship may be restricted. However, the cargo owner’s right to damages from the other ship at fault will not be limited. As a result, the cargo owner can sue the other ship for the full amount of its damages, under the maritime law of joint and several liability.</p>
<p>The other ship will then seek contribution from the cargo-carrying ship based on the latter’s degree of fault, so that the other ship does not bear an unfair proportion of the damages. In this way, cargo owners can avoid, and cargo-carrying ships can be denied, the contractual or statutory limitation of liability. The Both to Blame clause eliminates this issue by outlining an indemnification agreement, under which the cargo owner agrees to indemnify the cargo-carrying ship owner against any liability for damages paid to another ship in excess of the limitation amount.</p>
<h4 id="general-average-gain-ship-chartering"><strong>General Average (GA) in Ship Chartering</strong></h4>
<p>General Average (GA) is a customary legal principle recognized worldwide, which apportions losses suffered by one party for the collective benefit of all parties involved in a voyage. It originates from the shipmaster’s ancient right to sacrifice certain cargo or property or incur reasonable expenses to rescue the ship and its remaining cargo.</p>
<p>For instance, let us consider a scenario where a ship, carrying a load of cargo, encounters unforeseen weather conditions that lead to damage. As a result, the ship requires a salvage tug to tow it to port, incurring additional costs. Alternatively, it may become necessary for the shipmaster to jettison some cargo to save the rest of the cargo and the vessel. Maritime law has traditionally regarded such expenses or losses as eligible for distribution among all beneficiaries.</p>
<p>At the end of the voyage, an average adjuster is designated to compute the costs of the salvage claim or the value of the lost cargo, as well as the value of the saved ship and cargo. Subsequently, the adjuster usually allocates the loss against the shipowner and the cargo owners based on the proportionate interests in the voyage. The charters often contain clauses that specify the regulations for determining the procedure for general average. The most widely acknowledged provisions entail the application of the York Antwerp Rule 1974.</p>

<h4 id="new-jason-clause-in-ship-chartering"><strong>New Jason Clause in Ship Chartering</strong></h4>
<p>The New Jason Clause pertains to the concept of general average. According to the principles of general maritime law, cargo proprietors are typically exempt from contributing to general average if the loss incurred is a result of the shipowner’s negligence. However, shipowners often seek to overturn this rule by enforcing the New Jason Clause, which mandates that cargo owners are obligated to contribute to general average regardless of whether the loss was caused by the shipowner’s negligence.</p>

<p>Handysize bulk carriers are versatile vessels that play a crucial role in the global shipping industry. Chartering these carriers involves a complex process of negotiation, communication, and coordination between various stakeholders, including ship owners, charterers, brokers, and agents. In this guide, we will provide an overview of the handysize bulk carrier chartering process, along with key considerations to keep in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Market Research and Vessel Selection:</strong> Begin by conducting thorough market research to understand the current supply and demand dynamics for handysize bulk carriers. This information will help you to identify suitable vessels that meet your cargo transportation requirements. Pay close attention to factors like vessel size, age, fuel efficiency, and the availability of loading and discharging equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Chartering Options:</strong> There are several types of chartering options available for handysize bulk carriers:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voyage Charter:</strong> The ship owner is responsible for providing a seaworthy vessel, and the charterer pays a freight rate based on the cargo quantity and the distance between the loading and discharging ports.</li>
<li><strong>Time Charter:</strong> The charterer rents the vessel for a specified period, paying a daily hire rate. The charterer is responsible for covering the vessel’s operating expenses, including fuel, port charges, and canal fees.</li>
<li><strong>Bareboat Charter:</strong> The charterer rents the vessel without any crew, provisions, or insurance. The charterer is responsible for all operational expenses and management of the vessel.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Negotiating the Charter Party:</strong> Once you have identified a suitable vessel and chartering option, negotiations will begin between the ship owner and charterer, typically through a broker. Key terms to be negotiated include the freight or hire rate, laytime (the time allowed for loading and discharging cargo), demurrage (penalty for exceeding laytime), and any additional clauses specific to the cargo or route.</li>
<li><strong>Fixing the Vessel:</strong> Once the terms are agreed upon, the charter party is signed by both parties, and the vessel is considered “fixed.” The charterer will need to provide a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) to guarantee the fulfillment of contractual obligations.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-fixture Operations:</strong> Before the vessel’s arrival at the loading port, the charterer must coordinate with the ship owner, agents, and port authorities to ensure smooth operations. This includes preparing cargo documentation, arranging for surveys and inspections, and coordinating the vessel’s berthing and loading schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Voyage Execution:</strong> During the voyage, the charterer must monitor the vessel’s performance, fuel consumption, and adherence to the agreed-upon route. Regular communication with the vessel’s master and agents at the loading and discharging ports is essential to ensure timely operations and minimize delays.</li>
<li><strong>Post-fixture Operations:</strong> After the cargo has been discharged, the charterer must settle any outstanding financial matters, such as demurrage claims, and provide feedback on the vessel’s performance to the ship owner or broker.</li>
</ol>
<p>Handysize Bulk Carrier Chartering requires a deep understanding of market dynamics, careful selection of vessels and chartering options, and strong negotiation skills. By following these guidelines and maintaining open lines of communication throughout the process, charterers can successfully transport their cargo while minimizing risks and maximizing efficiency.</p>
