<p>##Rio+10</p>
<p>The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), also known as Rio+10, was held in Johannesburg, South Africa, from 26 August to 4 September 2002. It was a follow-up to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>

</ul>
<p>The Rio+10 Summit was a significant event in the history of sustainable development.

However, it is important to note that many of the goals and targets set at the Rio+20 Conference have not yet been achieved, and that the world still faces a number of challenges in achieving sustainable development.</p>
<h2 id="legacy-of-rio10-and-rio20">Legacy of Rio+10 and Rio+20</h2>
